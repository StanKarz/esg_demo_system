      "  Our Commitment to Sustainability Strengthens a Changing World\n",
      "    Dear customers and investors,\n",
      "      ALLETE is putting sustainability into action while honoring our commitments to the climate, our customers and the communities we serve. Building strong communities goes hand-in-hand with caring for the environment. People, planet, and prosperity are part of who we are and what we do every day.\n",
      "      At ALLETE, we recognize that impacts from climate change are real – we have taken action, and are committed to doing more. Our overall strategy is to enhance and grow our companies by providing sustainable energy solutions to meet changing societal expectations and evolving regulations.\n",
      "      All of our companies are engaged in this effort. Minnesota Power began delivering 50% renewable energy to customers in late 2020, the first Minnesota utility to achieve that milestone. Just one month later, the company announced its vision to deliver 100% carbon-free energy by 2050 with interim targets to reach 70% renewable energy and close one of two remaining coal units by 2030, and to achieve an 80% reduction in carbon emissions and coal-free operations by 2035. Our other utility company, Superior Water, Light & Power in Wisconsin, receives its energy from Minnesota Power and shares in these carbon-reduction and climate goals.\n",
      "      ALLETE Clean Energy continues to expand its national footprint through its success in creating clean-energy solutions for its customers. In 2020, it added two new wind projects to increase its wind facility portfolio to more than 1,000 megawatts (MWs) across seven states, and it has another 300-megawatt wind site under construction. ALLETE Clean Energy is now building on its reputation and strong track record of success to expand its focus beyond wind to additional opportunities within the clean-energy space.\n",
      "      BNI Energy’s focus on sustainability involves supporting its customer to advance an ambitious project to take the carbon emissions from a neighboring power plant and safely sequester them deep underground. If successful, it could make North Dakota’s lignite a valuable source of clean, affordable and reliable energy for decades to come.\n",
      "      Our view of sustainability, however, goes beyond reaching these important environmental and climate goals. It includes supporting our customers and local communities to foster a healthy and thriving society. While our companies provide essential services that are the backbone of our modern society, we also play an essential role in that society. As events of the past year have shown, we need resilient, equitable communities that offer diverse economic opportunities for everyone.\n",
      "      In viewing sustainability through that lens, we know that our actions outside of the clean-energy transition are critically important. We believe we must nurture a more diverse workforce to help build stronger communities. To do so, we strive to\n",
      "      create a work culture that embraces employees’ unique backgrounds, talents and perspectives and encourages them to achieve their fullest potential. With integrity as our foundation, we have created a corporate governance structure that serves as an example of diversity, equity and inclusion from the top down, and we have more work to do.\n",
      "      As a leading company in the region, our financial choices also can have a big impact. We have initiatives underway to support diverse businesses through our investment and purchasing decisions. It is equally important that we thoughtfully address our region’s social needs through our distribution of grants. We are committed to supporting programs that focus on education, income inequality, social justice and the opportunity gap.\n",
      "      The COVID-19 pandemic and turmoil during the past year exposed these social problems even further, prompting corporate and employee giving focused on immediate needs along with our usual broad donations. With many families working and learning from home, and the high demand for health-care services, the pandemic also reaffirmed the value of our essential, 24/7 energy services.\n",
      "      We have a saying at ALLETE that we strive to achieve “the right results, the right way.” This sustainability report highlights the many ways we achieved the right results, the right way for the climate, our customers, our communities and our employees. When we all work together to build equitable, healthy communities served by increasingly clean energy, we create the change we wish to see and build a better world for tomorrow.\n",

Additional guidance has been taken from the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), and other information and data has been sourced from ALLETE’s Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) reporting, as well as the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report.\n",
      "    ALLETE recognizes the significant impacts climate change can have on our businesses, and the importance of evaluating our business model for different climate-related transitions/pathways. Our recently announced carbon vision for Minnesota Power, ALLETE’s largest business unit, represents a proposed path that significantly reduces the risks of more aggressive carbon emission reduction scenarios that might be imposed by external parties through regulation or legislation. Subsequently, this report focuses on ALLETE’s actual and projected carbon reductions in comparison to state, national, and international goals. The comparison of our carbon vision to various carbon-reduction goals illustrates our proactive approach toward managing transitional risk associated with shifts to a lower-carbon economy.\n",
      "    We believe our considerable progress on reducing carbon emissions, coupled with our bold vision for the future, positions us to continue to be a leader in renewable energy and carbon reduction for decades to come. This combination of execution and vision helps ALLETE manage transitional and physical risks, while also providing an excellent platform for continuing the significant growth ALLETE has and continues to achieve.\n",

      "          Despite these plans, changes in the intensity, frequency, and duration of weather events due to climate change could stress availability of both internal and mutual-aid resources in restoring critical infrastructure.\n",
      "          Extreme or extended precipitation events can also significantly affect our operations. This could include inundation of critical infrastructure, including thermal and hydroelectric generation located next to surface waters or substations or other energy delivery infrastructure. Prolonged saturation of soils can also impact wooden power poles, causing structural concerns from increased microbial activity.\n",
      "        Water availability\n",
      "          Lack of water availability for our thermal and electrical conversion facilities is another potential physical risk due to climate change. Water is used for cooling purposes for our thermal facilities for electrical generation, and is also used to cool electrical conversion infrastructure at our high- voltage direct current (HVDC) conversion terminals in Minnesota and North Dakota. Additionally, Minnesota Power hydropower generation, both owned and purchased, depends on fairly consistent natural conditions for precipitation and evaporation, in addition to well-regulated water use conditions.\n",
      "          As detailed in the SASB report, Minnesota Power withdraws and consumes the most water of the ALLETE business units. However, Minnesota Power has significantly decreased water usage, totaling a 90% reduction at the largest generating facilities (Boswell, Laskin and Taconite Harbor) since 2005. In 2019, Minnesota Power withdrew 90,839,000 m3 of water, of which 15,713,000 m3 were for consumptive use. By comparison, Superior Water, Light & Power withdrew a total of 2,329,000 m3 for its residential, commercial, industrial, and all other customers in 2019. BNI withdrew 99,400 m3 for its coal mining operations. ALLETE Clean Energy’s water withdrawals were negligible, serving potable and domestic water usage, and were not reported for 2019 SASB metrics.\n",

      "        Climate-related transitional risks that could adversely affect our financial position include effects of environmental- or economic-based laws, regulations, incentives or initiatives designed to reduce the quantity and/or impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, restrictions on land use, wildlife impacts, and other environmental regulations could affect the siting, construction and operation of new or existing generation and transmission facilities needed to transition to lower-carbon generation sources.\n",
      "        One of the more significant transitional risks involves scenarios where carbon reduction or renewable generation requirements are mandated, but do not allow for a thoughtful transition to protect the safety, reliability and/ or affordability of energy for our customers. Requirements to pursue more aggressive carbon-reduction goals and renewable generation before cost- effective technology and regulatory policy have been established could place significant pressure on one or more of our businesses and/or our customers.\n",
      "        ALLETE also recognizes that some approaches to limit the worst impacts of climate change would require the electric sector to decarbonize faster than other sectors. In these scenarios, the electric sector reduces or eliminates carbon emissions 10-15 years prior to overall 2050 net-zero goals, which would allow electrification of other sectors and reduce overall net emissions. This “electric system first” approach represents significant risks and opportunities, which ALLETE closely tracks and incorporates into planning and strategic activities.\n",

SWLP also owns natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as water intake, treatment, and delivery. The reliable, safe and efficient delivery of electricity, natural gas, and water to our customers is of the utmost importance to our companies. Therefore, the companies consider emergency action response a key tool in managing risks from climate change to ensure reliable and safe service throughout different disruptions.\n",
      "          Our regulated operations design and build our infrastructure system to withstand various weather conditions, including high winds, ice, snow, and extreme heat and cold. Intense weather conditions, however, are beyond our control and at times do impact service to our customers. This risk factor is more prevalent with aboveground energy delivery systems, which can be more susceptible to extreme weather events. In those instances, we respond as expeditiously as possible, while also ensuring the continued safety of our personnel and the public.\n",
      "          The company strives to follow effective emergency management principles and protocols that enhance its ability to provide safe and reliable energy services. Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light & Power use the National Incident Management System (NIMS) to guide their Emergency Response Plans (ERP). The NIMS is a comprehensive national approach to incident management, applicable at all jurisdictional levels and across functional disciplines. It improves the effectiveness of emergency response providers and incident management organizations across\n",

      "          One of the most significant risk management activities ALLETE has undertaken is the reduction of consumptive and non-consumptive water use at Minnesota Power’s thermal facilities. Since 2005, Minnesota Power has reduced total water use by 90%, for an average water reduction of over 150 billion gallons per year. This has been the result of decreased cooling water use following the idling of Taconite Harbor Energy Center, the natural gas conversion of the Laskin Energy Center, and the retirement of Boswell Energy Center Units 1 and 2.\n",
      "          The remaining large thermal generation at Minnesota Power requires much less water to operate. This is a result of, among other things, the use of cooling towers rather than once-through cooling water for Boswell Units 3 and 4. A proposed dry cooling technology is also planned for the Nemadji Trail Energy Center. Additionally, the HVDC facilities in Center, North Dakota, and Hermantown, Minnesota, are also planned to be converted to dry cooling within the next five to six years.\n",
      "          Minnesota Power also uses a proactive planning approach to help predict and manage watershed dynamics for our renewable hydroelectric facilities. Each winter, Minnesota Power convenes a technical panel of public agency meteorological and natural resource experts, residents of the hydroelectric reservoirs watershed, and Minnesota Power operations to discuss current and forecasted temperature and precipitation conditions. Based off the current and predicted conditions, Minnesota Power selects a plan for subsequent hydropower operations to manage various requirements and expectations around reservoir levels, river flows and operational needs. This approach has been highly successful to account for variable and uncertain weather patterns, with Minnesota Power hydropower operations typically reaching desired refill targets for our reservoirs.\n",

Each SIT develops yearly safety plans for their areas and works to achieve initiatives that both align with broader safety goals as well as meet the needs of their individual company or site.\n",
      "        At ALLETE we choose to work safely for our families, each other and the public. We commit to be injury- free through continuous learning and improvement. Our safety value is based on the belief and commitment that everyone can go home unhurt each day.\n",

      "        : Minnesota Power environmental values include promoting water conservation and recycling, as well as full compliance with the numerous existing state and federal requirements regulating water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge. These regulations include both quantitative and qualitative restrictions on the amount, source, and constituents of the water used for operations. Water use information and water quality data is actively collected and reported in adherence with operating permits. Water management risks include emerging or increased limitations on both the quality and quantity of local water resources. Minnesota Power is proactive in monitoring and mitigating these risks through our participation in industry, scientific, and regional workgroups responsible for tracking and regulating water resources. Strategic internal teams focus on reducing or eliminating water use while leveraging water recycling opportunities. External partnerships with industry and regulatory agencies help to explore, evaluate, and ultimately establish water quality protections while remaining mindful of scientific, technical, and economic limitations. Furthermore, our water withdrawal permits are typically long-term approvals from state resource agencies, ranging from 30-50 years in duration, with sufficient water withdrawal volumes to ensure uninterrupted operations. As a result of this water management approach, MP has reduced water usage by 90% from 2005 levels, with additional water use reduction projects planned in the future. MP’s water withdrawal rates and water discharge rates will continue to decrease significantly as we convert to dry handling and storage of coal combustion residuals, install thermal evaporation unit at Boswell, and reduce or eliminate cooling water use at our Arrowhead and Center high-voltage direct current conversion facilities. As we reduce overall water usage, our water quality for discharges are designed to continue to meet or exceeds state and national water quality standards.\n",

The Company works closely with area fuel assistance and weatherization agencies, landlords, and housing authorities, low-income advocacy groups, fellow energy providers, and local community agencies and leaders to collaborate on service offerings and outreach. In fact, there are numerous programs in place today to help customers save energy, have flexible payment options, and/or receive energy assistance.

Under CARE, those who qualify under the federally-funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (“LIHEAP”), as determined by application through Energy Assistance Program Service Providers, are eligible. Minnesota Power also recently received approval of its proposed program modifications for CARE, including a nearly doubling of the annual CARE budget from nearly $1M to $1.75M. These consensus-driven program modifications were developed collaboratively through a robust stakeholder engagement process and are intended to provide additional relief to low income customers in northern Minnesota. The modifications use a combination of a low barrier, automated discount through the flat discount component, as well as a targeted energy burden discount that would be more meaningful for higher usage low income customers. This targeted discount is on a first-come, first-served basis. Program changes went into effect January 1, 2020.\n",

The distribution systems consist of mains, which are usually located along or under city streets, and smaller service lines that branch off the mains and distribute natural gas service to homes and businesses. None of these pipeline systems are constructed of potentially high-risk materials, such as cast and wrought iron or unprotected bare steel. SWL&P is dedicated to keeping its employees, customers, and communities safe through training, education, and awareness. All SWL&P journeymen crews and service responders are trained on emergency response and are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, our company’s Transmission and Distribution Integrity Management Programs provide a process for inspecting and assessing the condition of SWL&P-owned natural gas pipelines and establishing a maintenance program based on regulatory requirements and best industry practices.\n",

      "│       ├── As a leading company in the region, our financial choices also can have a big impact. We have initiatives underway to support diverse businesses through our investment and purchasing decisions. It is equally important that we thoughtfully address our region’s social needs through our distribution of grants. We are committed to supporting programs that focus on education, income inequality, social justice and the opportunity gap.\n",

With many families working and learning from home, and the high demand for health-care services, the pandemic also reaffirmed the value of our essential, 24/7 energy services.\n",
      "│       ├── We have a saying at ALLETE that we strive to achieve “the right results, the right way.” This sustainability report highlights the many ways we achieved the right results, the right way for the climate, our customers, our communities and our employees. When we all work together to build equitable, healthy communities served by increasingly clean energy, we create the change we wish to see and build a better world for tomorrow.\n",

These regulations include both quantitative and qualitative restrictions on the amount, source, and constituents of the water used for operations. Water use information and water quality data is actively collected and reported in adherence with operating permits. Water management risks include emerging or increased limitations on both the quality and quantity of local water resources. Minnesota Power is proactive in monitoring and mitigating these risks through our participation in industry, scientific, and regional workgroups responsible for tracking and regulating water resources. Strategic internal teams focus on reducing or eliminating water use while leveraging water recycling opportunities. External partnerships with industry and regulatory agencies help to explore, evaluate, and ultimately establish water quality protections while remaining mindful of scientific, technical, and economic limitations. Furthermore, our water withdrawal permits are typically long-term approvals from state resource agencies, ranging from 30-50 years in duration, with sufficient water withdrawal volumes to ensure uninterrupted operations. As a result of this water management approach, MP has reduced water usage by 90% from 2005 levels, with additional water use reduction projects planned in the future. MP’s water withdrawal rates and water discharge rates will continue to decrease significantly as we convert to dry handling and storage of coal combustion residuals, install thermal evaporation unit at Boswell, and reduce or eliminate cooling water use at our Arrowhead and Center high-voltage direct current conversion facilities. As we reduce overall water usage, our water quality for discharges are designed to continue to meet or exceeds state and national water quality standards.\n",

The distribution systems consist of mains, which are usually located along or under city streets, and smaller service lines that branch off the mains and distribute natural gas service to homes and businesses. None of these pipeline systems are constructed of potentially high-risk materials, such as cast and wrought iron or unprotected bare steel. SWL&P is dedicated to keeping its employees, customers, and communities safe through training, education, and awareness. All SWL&P journeymen crews and service responders are trained on emergency response and are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, our company’s Transmission and Distribution Integrity Management Programs provide a process for inspecting and assessing the condition of SWL&P-owned natural gas pipelines and establishing a maintenance program based on regulatory requirements and best industry practices.\n",

BNI continues to be on the leading edge of agricultural practices. No-till agriculture, cover crops, livestock integration, and rotational grazing are all practices used to increase overall soil health and consequently increase plant production and grassland diversity. These land management practices are critical to returning the land to greater value (empirical and intrinsic) than pre- mining. Since 2017, BNI has hosted North Dakota State University research plots testing various techniques to increase water infiltration, reduce compaction, and species richness. Soil diversity is achieved through seed mixes, lift thicknesses, and re-spread depths. These data and research conclusions are anticipated to improve short and long term land management techniques and subsequent regulations.
