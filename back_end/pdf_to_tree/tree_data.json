The development and applications of emerging science and technologies can help drive a step change in climate risk assessments. We have partnered with the UK Met Office to build the world's most powerful supercomputer for weather and climate, and with CSIRO to build a science-based climate intelligence platform for Australia. We are also partnering with climate researchers to use AI to improve the assessment and management of climate risks. We have advanced subseasonal forecasting by incorporating machine learning, which we are also using to better understand the cause-and-effect relationships between physical and societal risks. Researchers at Microsoft, the Universitat de Valencia, and the University of Reading are collaborating to demonstrate the usefulness of causal machine learning methods for climate risk assessment, in the context of food security in Africa. The project plans to blend expert domain knowledge from NGOs working in the Horn of Africa with advances in causal machine learning techniques and tools, such as the CAUSEME web platform and the EconML software package, to better understand the impact of humanitarian interventions on food security in this region.", "parent_id": "b2097", "children_ids": ["b2095"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "b2095", "text_str": "Harnessing the power of AI, we are helping to manage global climate risk and build climate resilience.", "parent_id": "b2098", "children_ids": [], "children_nodes": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"self_id": "c314", "text_str": "Climate Innovation Fund ", "parent_id": "c286", "children_ids": ["c315", "c322", "c326"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "c315", "text_str": "Investing in climate innovation ", "parent_id": "c314", "children_ids": ["c316", "c317", "c321"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "c316", "text_str": "Investing in water and resilience ", "parent_id": "c315", "children_ids": [], "children_nodes": []}, {"self_id": "c317", "text_str": "Investing to scale carbon and renewable energy markets ", "parent_id": "c315", "children_ids": ["c318", "c319", "c320"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "c318", "text_str": "Scaling carbon removal ", "parent_id": "c317", "children_ids": [], "children_nodes": []}, {"self_id": "c319", "text_str": "Verifying carbon-free energy consumption ", "parent_id": "c317", "children_ids": [], "children_nodes": []}, {"self_id": "c320", "text_str": "Advancing carbon transformation ", "parent_id": "c317", "children_ids": [], "children_nodes": []}]}, {"self_id": "c321", "text_str": "Supporting commercialization with blended capital ", "parent_id": "c315", "children_ids": ["b2141", "b2105", "b2107"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "b2141", "text_str": "Overview Microsoft sustainability", "parent_id": "c321", "children_ids": [], "children_nodes": []}, {"self_id": "b2105", "text_str": "70", "parent_id": "c321", "children_ids": ["b2142", "b2106"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "b2142", "text_str": "Carbon", "parent_id": "b2105", "children_ids": [], "children_nodes": []}, {"self_id": "b2106", "text_str": "| | |", "parent_id": "b2105", "children_ids": ["b2143", "b2145"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "b2143", "text_str": "Water", "parent_id": "b2106", "children_ids": ["b2144"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "b2144", "text_str": "Waste", "parent_id": "b2143", "children_ids": [], "children_nodes": []}]}, {"self_id": "b2145", "text_str": "Ecosystems", "parent_id": "b2106", "children_ids": [], "children_nodes": []}]}]}, {"self_id": "b2107", "text_str": "Climate Innovation Fund", "parent_id": "c321", "children_ids": ["b2108"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "b2108", "text_str": "Investing in climate innovation", "parent_id": "b2107", "children_ids": ["b2109", "b2113", "b2119", "b2135"], "children_nodes": [{"self_id": "b2109", "text_str": "Microsoft is investing to accelerate climate innovation through our $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund (CIF).
