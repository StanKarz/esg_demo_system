This was something that immediately became apparent to me when I started as CEO of Gurit in January 2021. \"With passion for a sustainable future\", our company vision, is not only words to us; it is something we","use as a guiding principle in everything we do. Today, well over three-quarters of our business is fully dedicated to renewable energy. Sustainable business is and will remain our strong focus. As a system partner for the global wind energy industry, we can continue to serve our ethical purpose while contributing to sustainable growth in this market, thereby increasing the renew able energy generation in the world. As experts on high- performance materials and engineering within the light- weighting sector, we facilitate innovative and energy- efficient solutions for rail, marine and aerospace as well as other industries. The concept of sustainable busi- ness at Gurit also means a culture of respect, fostering diversity, transparent employee communication and a strong focus on the development of our people. This is our passion! Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 56 Safety First – building a strong safety culture Safety First is one of","Gurit’s core values and some- thing that we are working on every day. The health and safety of our employees, customers and suppliers al- ways comes first! In 2020, our Safety First initiative was launched and a tremendous amount of work was done to embed safety as an essential part of our company culture. One major initiative was improving the safety of the work environments at all our sites. Employee in- volvement is a key factor required to reach the ambitious targets we have set for ourselves. We are proud to announce that Gurit will reach carbon neutrality in 2021 for the emissions we can directly influence and control. As we all know, curbing humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions is a pressing en- vironmental challenge that demands swift and efficient actions. During 2020, our teams worked hard to assess our global footprint on greenhouse gas emissions for the first time. We","will now use this assessment as a basis to define purposeful measures to drive future action. We want to and must take responsibility for our emissions, and will avoid and reduce greenhouse gas emissions wherever we can. As first steps, in 2021 we will source all our electrical power from 100% renewable sources and will compensate for our direct and part of our in- direct emissions by financing a carbon avoidance pro- ject: a windfarm in India that replaces a fossil fuel power plant. Reaching climate neutrality is imperative for us in our mission to be a successful sustainable business. In February 2021, Gurit was included in the SIX Swiss Exchanges’ new ESG indexes \"SPI ESG\" and \"SPI ESG Weighted\". We are proud of this recognition of our on- going sustainability efforts and see this as an encour- agement to continue our journey. Support of the Ten Principles of the","United Nations Global Compact I am pleased to confirm that Gurit reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Com- pact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. Our annual communication on pro- gress is part of this 2020 Gurit Sustainability Report in which we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We invite our stakeholders to join us on our sustainabil- ity journey and we thank our employees and corporate partners for participating in this effort with us. Yours sincerely, Mitja Schulz, CEO Zurich, February 2021 57 Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 UN Global Compact: communication on progress Gurit’s communication on progress 2020 Gurit’s objectives for 2021 HUMAN RIGHTS 1 Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights – Inclusion in terms &","conditions, contractual agreements – Mandatory online trainings as part of Code of Conduct A safety initiative was rolled out at all sites in 2020, implementing a safety culture, providing workers with a safe and healthy workplace. “Safety First” was adopted as a company core value. Read more in the Gurit Sustainability Report 2020, p. 68-79. The initiative further improved the working facilities and raised awareness for all aspects of health and safety. Gurit undertakes to protect workers from workplace harassment, including physical, verbal, sexual or psychological harassment, abuse or threats. In December 2020, Gurit adopted a Sus- tainability Policy, comprising a social policy statement emphasizing our continuous efforts towards the UNGC principles. – Procurement Standards & Training – Internal Audit Checklist – Internal Awareness Training for Senior Managers 2 No complicity in human rights abuses – Awareness raising and monitoring by Global Procurement Team Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report","58 PRINCIPLE 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, within the scope of their influence PRINCIPLE 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery PRINCIPLE 9 Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies PRINCIPLE 8 Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility PRINCIPLE 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges PRINCIPLE 6 Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation PRINCIPLE 2 Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses PRINCIPLE 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining PRINCIPLE 4 Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour PRINCIPLE 5 Businesses should uphold the abolition of child labour Gurit’s communication on progress 2020","Gurit’s objectives for 2021 LABOUR STANDARDS 3 Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining – Monitoring for potential complaints Gurit Management members ensure to the best of their knowledge that the company does not participate in any form of forced or bonded labour.

This endeavour was undertaken after Group Senior Management held its annual meeting and determined it to be one of its top priorities. During the year, this program was introduced across all sites and operations, following the creation of a new internal safety organisational structure and with the support of an external consultant. This new thorough structure includes a Safety First Core team, site Safety Managers, Operations, and Maintenance. By including members representing different parts of the organisa- tion, a variety of issues and aspects are brought to the table which increases relevance of measures designed. The structure has attained buy-in and participation among employees worldwide. – Objectives and ambitions Ambition: zero work-related injuries and illnesses. Prevent, limit or mitigate harm, notably workplace injuries. Protect our employees’ and customers’ health. Target: reduce accidents in the","workplace by 50% within three years (2020-2022), or by 17% per year. – Provide our customers with products complying with best-in-class health & safety. – Promote the safe use of products by our custom- ers as well as within our operations. – Training: ensure a high level of know-how and skills as a foundation for a Safety First culture. – Improve processes, manage risks, report and follow up all work-related incidents/illnesses, raise awareness for health and safety as well as productivity benefits in the long run. – Phase out various chemicals of concern (SVHC) by 2022.

Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 70 Situation analysis: internal perception of safety At the start of the Safety First initiative, a safety perception survey was conducted amongst all employees at all sites. The survey was translated into different local languages and made available electronically as well as on paper for shopfloor workers without a company e-mail account. 24 core questions were asked to gauge the level of under- standing of the safety perception at all sites and to create a baseline for the intended cultural transformation process. More importantly, all employees got involved and interactively engaged from the very beginning. A specialised ex- ternal consultant, DSS DuPont Sustainable Solutions supported Gurit with this process. Using the","DuPont Bradley Curve™ the subjective perception of all participating staff members has been analysed and initial focus areas for priority action have been identified. N GRI 403-4 Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and safety The DuPont Bradley Curve™ was used by DSS consultants to comprehend and benchmark Gurit’s safety perfor- mance and to better understand the effectiveness of a successful safety culture from an early stage through maturity which is sustainable with the ambition for injury rates near zero. Processes and systems introduced Gurit has built up a comprehensive occupational health and safety management system covering all sites of the Group. Besides the standards described below, a dedicated health and safety organisational structure has been set up, with defined responsibilities at Group, Business Unit and Site level. These responsibilities are complemented with dedicated health & safety officers at site level, an extensive training program and a monthly","tracking and review at monthly Business Unit and Executive Committee meetings of defined KPI on accidents and incidents (LTAR, LTIR). The implementation followed the company’s own internal ambitions described above and the implementation has been aligned with recognised standards and supported by a specialised external consultant, DSS DuPont Sus- tainable Solutions in the period of November 2019 until December 2020. N GRI 403-1 Occupational health and safety management system “A successful safety culture empowers people, while improving quality, productivity and profits. In a mature safety culture, the so called “interdependent stage”, safety is truly sustainable, with injury rates approaching zero. People feel empowered to act as needed to work safely. They support and challenge each other. The organisation realises significant business benefits through higher quality, greater productivity and increased profits.” Jörg Bremer Market Leader D/A/CH, DuPont Sustainable Solutions 71 Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 The Safety Pyramid As a","further step, Gurit has introduced the Safety Pyramid as a means to reduce accidents at the workplace. The base of the pyramid, and keystone to the Safety First trainings, is the observation of risks and hazards. Systemati- cally looking for potential dangers in operations and workplace procedures is a first step to reduce serious injuries. This involves systematic reviews of the workplace and analysis of lost-time injury data. By ingraining the evaluation of hazardous situations into the habits of all employees, the Safety Pyramid becomes a self-supporting tool that may help to reduce near-misses and minor injuries, and then proportionally reduce severe injuries and deaths. Incident Investigation & Reporting The Incident Investigation & Reporting Standard, developed and rolled out in 2020, provides requirements and guidance for a systematic, in-depth approach to health and safety (H&S) incident investigations. This standard focuses especially on practical implementation and enhancement of the cultural building","elements in all parts of the – operations by emphasising the following: Management responsibilities – Selection of the investigation team – An investigation process for all sites of the Group, including determination of facts and key factors – Corrective and preventive recommendations – Communication of the investigation’s findings in an Incident Investigation Report – Follow-up system for the investigation’s findings, including responsibilities and dates for implementation – Management systems – Additional requirements by local regulations 2A LOST TIME ACCIDENT 2B LOST TIME ILLNESS 2 LOST TIME ACCIDENT Lost time accident / illness 1 DEATH 1 DEATH 3 NON LOST TIME INJURY 3A RESTRICTED WORK INJURY 3B MEDICAL TREATMENT INJURY 3C FIRST AID INJURY 3D NO TREATMENT INJURY 5 RISK SITUATION HAZARDOUS OBSERVATION 5 RISK SITUATION HAZARDOUS OBSERVATION 4 NEAR MISS 4 NEAR MISS Total recordable injuries All injuries/ illnesses All incidents Gurit Safety Pyramid Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report","72 Safety Walk Standard The Gurit Safety Walk Standard describes how to per- form Safety Walks with the purpose of improving safe- ty behaviour and preventing injuries and property loss. The desired result is reached through promoting dia- logue and awareness by practically applying established standards for work behaviour in day-to-day operations, and by training employees to actively observe and iden- tify both unsafe and safe procedures. The Safety Walk standard has been introduced at all production sites and enables immediate mitigation of risks and recognition of best practices. To compensate for the limited travelling opportunity and social distancing measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, a video tutorial has been made available in several languages. N GRI 403-2 Hazard identification Training modules The Gurit health and safety trainings are focusing on the two standards mentioned above – Incident Investigation and Reporting and Safety Walks. The initial phase aimed to improve","the awareness of senior managers. After completion of the first round of trainings, sites started educating local managers and supervisors and subse- quently all employees. The response to the trainings has been excellent so far with a satisfaction level of 90%. Screenshots Gurit Safety Walk Video Tutorial “Our Training program is helping us to proactively find solutions to reduce potential risks and to share examples of best practices with the rest of the organisation. Our health and safety activities are helping us to create a workspace that is safe for all of us. We encourage your commitment and active contribution. Let us make Gurit a safe place.” Ernst Lutz General Manager Business Unit Wind Materials CULTURAL CHANGE SAFETY WALK TRAINING INCIDENT INVESTIGATION & REPORTING TRAIN THE TRAINER GENERAL SAFETY AWARENESS 73 Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 Train the trainer Extensive employee involvement is one of the key factors in","the building of a stringent safety culture and therefore a central element in the Safety First initiative at Gurit. To solidly implement both health and safety standards and strengthen cultural aspects throughout the organisation, Gurit has adopted the \"train the trainer\" concept. Desig- nated employees, called safety representatives, have dual roles of both training attendees and later as trainers for other groups of colleagues. This creates a functional cascade and increases engagement and understanding of the Safety First concepts defined at Corporate level. The trainers will be equipped with the necessary tools and expertise to roll out the Incident Investigation & Reporting and the Safety Walk standards, conduct trainings and ensure local implementation on site. Every employee is urged to take responsibility for the adherence of the standards, rules and regulations to make the working environment as safe as it can possibly be, for themselves and each other. Safety Systems","Sites Evaluation With the objective to monitor each factory regarding safety, with the identification and evaluation of all the el- ements that have a relevant influence on a site’s safety performance, Gurit’s Safety First Core team has created a process that supports Site Managers in establishing priorities to be carried out in each factory. This metric assists Management with putting the necessary efforts and resources into the appropriate systems, and sup- ports the follow-up of implementation progress of relat- ed actions. The process consists of a standardised self-evaluation questionnaire for each site and a quarterly review process at site and business unit levels. The local Site Management jointly conducts the self-assessment, involving Operations, Maintenance and Safety Managers to allow for a common view and recognition of the state of the Safety Elements. Ideally it is designed to correlate with the Safety Pyramid. The Safety Systems Sites Evaluation process was drafted","in 2020 and is scheduled to be fine-tuned and rolled-out in 2021. N GRI 403-2 Hazard identification High ambitions for a great cause The company aspires to have zero work-related injuries and illnesses. To achieve and maintain such an objective, commitment and determination at all levels of the organisation is required. We are here to pursue our goal “Zero Accidents”, because we strongly believe every accident is avoidable.

I am very satisfied with the result so far.” Hannes Haueis Head of Group Human Resources Safety training at Gurit’s new Mexican site 75 Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 Communication on occupational health and safety As part of the roll-out of its Safety First initiative, Gurit has strengthened its internal communication","at Corporate and site levels. Measures include an employee safety perception survey sent to all staff members and translated into the local working languages, a safety newsletter available in various translations, and the implementation of reg- ular safety meetings at site level, either with all staff or established Safety Committees. During these meetings, employees receive information and have the opportunity to raise concerns or share safety observations. Safety briefs have been implemented as a standard procedure at shift changes and depending on the site weekly, bi-weekly or quarterly meetings have been set up. Due to COVID-19, the facilitation of larger group meetings or townhall gatherings has not been possible or limited. The meetings are to start with a safety observation and then continue with sharing of both best-practice observations, as well as learnings from accidents, incidents or near-misses. N GRI 403-4 Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and","safety Work-related injuries and ill health The number of work-related accidents has decreased in 2020, but the work-related incidents have increased slight- ly, with many chemical burns reported by the production site in Canada. Gurit recorded no fatalities among workers or contractors and only one incident among contractors.

Of specific note to the composites industry was the inclusion of Bisphenol A","and Nonyl Phenol. These substances are present in many amine-based hardeners and, although they can provide very effective technical benefits, the hazard profiles of endocrine disruption and bio-persistence mean that removal of such substances is of paramount importance. A key target set out by Gurit in 2017 was to remove all SVHCs from all Gurit standard and essential products by 2022. This is a major task given that the European Chemicals Agency are designating more SVHCs every year. The removal of such substances not only eliminates these harsh chemicals from the supply chain, but also reduces reporting requirements for our customers such as those under new European waste reporting schemes in force from 2021. Gurit is currently on track for this target with a large reduction in the number of Gurit materials affected – from 65% in 2017 to currently 11% of products (in standard and essential ranges within the","Formulated, Prepreg and Core product offering). The set target of <15% for 2020 is met and on track for the <10% target Gurit had set itself for 2022. The number of SVHCs used in Gurit products has been reduced from a maximum of 10 substances in 2019 to only 3 in 2020. The graph illustrates the situation as of December 31, 2020. At this time 211 substances are designated as SVHCs by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).

Some of these products also incorporate Gurit’s unique Light Reflecting Technology, allowing the user to detect the presence of contamination on clothing and around the work environment in order to monitor exposure with the support of a simple UV light. All these measures are part of Gurit’s commitment to provide customers with products complying with best-in-class health and safety standards. Information and Training is also part of this commitment. Gurit informs its sites and customers about the availability of a round-the-clock emergency hotline for use in the event of any chemical related incident such as fire, spillage or exposure. The emergency contact details are given out on all product Safety Data Sheets and dangerous good notes where required. The details are also","displayed on the website and technical data sheets. Carechem 24 is a service provided by the United Kingdom’s National Chemical Emergency Centre (NCEC) and provides a global ser- vice of emergency contact telephone numbers for each global region.

And while sustainability is already at the heart of our business, Gurit has decided to go even further and become a climate-neutral company. To achieve this objective in 2021, Gurit will switch its entire electricity consumption to renewable sources by the end of the year, and will provide support to compensatory projects. Gurit will offset its direct emissions (GHG scope 1) and its indirect upstream and downstream emissions (partial GHG scope 3) where Gurit believes to have direct control and reliable data. The main vectors of our environmental efforts are minimising our impacts by avoiding or reducing emissions, and by making use of natural resources effectively and responsibly. We reduce or","eliminate the use of chemicals of concern, and we evaluate and encourage options for cleaner technologies in all our operations. We systematically assess, manage and communicate risks and apply precaution in terms of health, safety and the environment when there is reasonable suspicion of harm. Environment “Being a sustainable business will remain a strong focus, and we are proud to have taken the first step towards becoming climate-neutral in 2021.” Mitja Schulz CEO Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 82 In 2020, Gurit analysed its greenhouse gas emissions with an eye towards achieving carbon neutrality. First, direct emissions from stationary and mobile emissions sources were evaluated, as was the electrical power consumption of all Group sites. Also assessed were emissions related to capital goods, waste, employee com- mutes, business travel and the transportation of our products. These analyses correspond directly to scope 1 (direct emissions), scope 2 (purchased electricity), and","a part of scope 3 (indirect upstream and down- stream emissions) of the global greenhouse gas protocols. Gurit believes it has direct influence over this data and that the data is of sufficient quality. The remainder are other up- and downstream emissions, e.g. purchased goods such as carbon fibre materials acquired based on customer demand, and related transportation. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected part of the reporting period and may have caused lower emissions generated from less business travel and a significant reduction in process emissions related to a reduced production volume for the Aerospace market. Despite this global health crisis, most of Gurit’s sites have remained open, or closed only for a short time, and so the impact on employees commuting has been minimal, but employees may have been commuting with their private car rather than public transport. Concerning the transportation of produced and traded products, some as- sumptions","have been made to compensate for data not yet available.

Electricity for all operations will be sourced exclusively from renewable resources, thereby eliminating reliance upon fossil-fuel-based power generation. Furthermore, Gurit has adopted a global co-location strategy for its structural core materials manufacturing, with a “local for local” approach. Placing kitting facilities adjacent to PET extruders and near customer production sites will significantly reduce transport requirements to customers. This initiative be- gan with Gurit’s China facility, has expanded to a new site in Mexico, and is underway in India. Gurit will also review production processes to minimise emissions, further reduce waste and further increase the efficiency of resource utilisation, transportation and business travel. Direct emissions that cannot yet be avoided or reduced will be compensated by investing in carbon avoiding ini- tiatives outside of Gurit’s supply chain, such as a wind park in India that replaces fossil-fuel-generated electricity. As","a result of these initiatives, as of 2021, Gurit will be climate-neutral in its contribution to greenhouse gases for its direct emissions and electrical power consumption, as well as for emissions related to waste, commuting of employ- ees, business travel and transportation of our own products.

Some began in 2020, some will be kicked off in 2021, with the purpose of developing dedicated action plans. These actions will include: – improving our energy efficiency and increasing our use of renewable electricity – minimising waste and increasing recycling of materials – optimising transportation, promoting the co-location of core material manufacturing and kitting operations – eliminating","or minimising the of the use of chemicals of concern – reducing process emissions and fugitive emissions – promoting the use of recycled materials – encouraging innovation and use of clean technologies Production process emissions Greenhouse gases Transportation, Travel Purchased goods & services Renewable energy Resource utilisation Recycling Waste reduction End of life Innovation Sustainable materials cradle to gate cradle to grave today target Raw materials Production Distribution Sale Disposal Transport Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 86 Illustrative example of eliminating waste as an area of action for greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability while improving quality and efficiency Innovation in packaging design to reduce transportation emissions A re-design initiative to establish an improved packaging solution for preimpregnated fabrics (prepreg) materials has been undertaken during 2020. Prepregs are typically transported in large rolls and the new packaging solution drastically increases shipping efficiency. This is achieved by reducing the volume of","the packages and therefore enabling larger quantities of the products to be fitted into a container or truck, consequently decreasing the number of transports required for the same product quantity. When shipping by truck, 45 more rolls/boxes can be accommodated in a full truck load, allowing for an up to 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per square meter transported on the road and up to 50% reduction in a regular seafreight container. This smart improvement benefiting customers and our environment illustrates Gurit’s ongoing commitment and passion for a sustainable future.

Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 87 saving 28 000 tons of CO2eq annually CO2 As of 2021, Gurit will source all its electricity from renewable power sources. For those sites not already sourcing their electricity from renewable power generation, the Group will purchase Energy Attribution Certificates (EAC), a proven method to document and track the consumption of energy in the respective country of operation. This will be done on the basis of the 2020 figures and provides for the compensation of 28 000 tons of CO2e emissions. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions avoided by switching to renewable energy corresponds to the equivalent amount of emissions caused by driving 3 084 times around the globe in an average car, or flying 4 203 times around the globe in economy class, or 84 000 m3","of avoided loss of arctic ice. 100% electricity from renewable energy sources Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 88 Financing a renewable wind energy project replacing fossil-fuel generated electricity To achieve carbon neutrality in 2021 for its scope 1 and partial scope 3 emissions that today cannot yet be avoided or reduced within our operations, Gurit is financing part of an onshore wind park in Saipuram in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. This project replaces fossil-fuel generated electricity. At the same time the Saipuram wind park provides job opportunities and training to upskill local staff, supporting four UN Sustainable Development Goals. The Certificate of Verified Carbon Unit (VCU) Retirement of 66 984 Verified Carbon Units has been issued on behalf of Gurit Holding AG on January 21, 2021. The VCU serial number is 9334-80963563-81030546-VCS- VCU-997-VER-IN-1-1788-04082018-31122018-0.

The standards were developed in part- nership between the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The accounting was based on the principles of the ‘GHG Protocol’: Relevance, Completeness, Consistency, Transparency and Accuracy. GHG Accounting The accounting and footprint","calculations were done with the support of an external consultant, the Swiss-based South Pole company. The data inventory was based on data provided by Gurit. Data has been collected via questionnaires sent to all sites, as well as to the Global Procurement and Human Resources departments. The data has not been audited or verified by a third par- ty. If no primary data was available, secondary data was taken into account, such as industry or national averages, monetary spent data, ex- trapolations based on information from other sites, or data from the GHG Accounting of the previous year. Where activity data of the inventory was lacking, extrapolations and estimations were made by either South Pole or Gurit experts such as the Head of Product Development, Product Managers, Site Managers or the Head of Opera- tions of the production site concerned. This was done according to their best knowledge, but such","estimates cannot completely compensate the ab- sence of real data. Therefore, future variances in year-on-year data may or may not reflect an im- provement of data quality, rather than a change in performance. Emission factors The emission factors for the different catego- ries are based on renowned databases such as Ecoinvent, the world’s leading LCI database, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) UK and the United States Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. Overall, the data inventory, emission factors and assumptions are in line with the ‘GHG Protocol’. The choice of as- sumptions and emission factors always followed a conservative approach. Unless otherwise spec- ified, all emission values in the greenhouse gas report are given in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Therefore, not only CO2 is taken into account, but also the other greenhouse gases mentioned in the Kyoto Protocol, e.g., methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).","Global Warming Potential (GWP) is a measure of the climate impact of a GHG compared to carbon dioxide over a time horizon, which is necessary to unify the emissions to one unit for the different GHG. GHG emissions have different GWP values depending on their efficiency to absorb longwave radiation and the atmospheric lifetime of the gas. The GWP values used in GHG accounting include the six GHGs covered by the United Na- tions Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Kyoto Protocol and blends from these. These are the GWP used by BEIS and are based on the ‘Intergovernmental Panel on Cli- mate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)’.

Therefore, any variance year-on-year may be related to improving data quality, rather than actual performance. The total energy consumption within the organisation has been cal- culated by our external partner South Pole Carbon Asset Management","AG as part of a mandate to analyse Gurit’s greenhouse gas emissions.

For example, in the UK, a demand- driven control system was installed in October 2020. It regulates and reduces run time and power consump- tion for two vacuum pumps used in formulated liquids production. The effect of this has been to reduce power consumption over a 24 hour period from ~250 kWh to 25 kWh on the on-demand","pump. In China, four electric forklifts replaced diesel forklifts, resulting in a reduction of diesel consumption by 2 600 litres. In Denmark, the detection of compressed air leaks resulted in an esti- mated annual energy reduction of 47 303 kWh. Other initiatives around the world contribute to the reduction of energy consumption at Gurit sites: – Keeping the indoor temperature of air conditioning at 25 Celsius during office hours. – Switching off all power supplies when the office is empty. – Unplugging electrical appliances / equipment which are not in use. – Increasing production speed and minimising changeover time to optimise prepreg machine running, resulting in a reduction of energy con- sumption as the time required for the machine to run was reduced. N GRI 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption Energy consumption outside the organisation For the assessment of its Greenhouse gas footprint, Gurit has started to evaluate the energy","consumption outside the organisation, which relates to the upstream categories and downstream categories (scope 3). Most of this data relates to suppliers and has not been avail- able in the required quality. Gurit has used an assump- tion-based approach to compensate for the absence of data in order to get a broader understanding and priori- tise focus areas for future action. The quality of the data is not suitable for external reporting purposes but will be used starting in 2021 for related internal workstreams that will look at reducing greenhouse emissions within scope 3. Data assessed internally involve the following categories and are reported under Greenhouse gas emissions in – CO2e: Business travel – Employee commuting – Transportation of produced and traded products – Waste – Capital goods – Fuel- and energy-related N GRI 302-2 Energy consumption outside the organisation Energy intensity The energy intensity of electricity consumption (kWh) versus","sales (continued business) has been calculated with 0.12 for 2019.

We focus not only on the materials we dispose of, but on the manner in which we design our pro- cesses and products to minimise environmental impact. This includes the efficient use of resources, re-designing packaging to reduce transportation requirements, and the recovery of materials in order to re-introduce them to the production cycle.

Gurit has","adopted a co-location strategy which consists of lo- cating its PET core material manufacturing sites in close proximity to kitting operations. This allows us to recycle core material waste generated during kitting operations by re-utilising them in the extrusion process. Furthermore, the packaging of the formulated product range has been improved and optimised for less waste and easier-to-recycle materials. N GRI 306-2 Management of significant waste-related impacts Reclaimed products and their packaging materials For the remainder of operations, Gurit production sites have reported 1 128 t of recycled pallets and 166 t of recycled cardboard and plastics. Several thousands of metallic stillage are reused for prepreg rolls deliveries to customers served from our prepreg production site in Spain. Due to the nature of advanced composites that have a product life of several decades, as well as the fact that Gurit provides semi-finished materials that are further processed by customers into","their respective end products, there is no data available regarding reclaimed products beyond the PET product range. N GRI 301-3 Reclaimed products and their packaging materials Waste generation and significant waste-related impacts For the calculation of its greenhouse gas footprint, Gurit took into consideration its entire value chain, and Prod- uct Development, Technical Support, Sales and Pro- curement specialists have initiated a process to look at waste-related impacts during the product use phase when our products are processed at our direct custom- ers, as well as end-of-life aspects of our semi-finished and finished products with the end customers. As part of its Sustainability Strategy, Gurit will set up dedicated workstreams to analyse the waste workstreams along its value chain and address end-of-life solutions for its products. In 2020, Gurit recycled 9 900 metric tons of PET or 825 million post-consumer PET drinking bottles into structural core PET foam. N GRI","306-1 Waste generation and significant waste-related impacts Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 95 Gurit sources the water for its production sites from measured public utilities networks. To this date, Gurit is not aware of water sources significantly affected by the withdrawal of the water the company consumes. Gurit considers its impact on water resources as not causing high levels of water stress. Our production sites use water responsibly and consider water usage in the process design. Gurit sites have not reported any discharges to surface waters and no significant spills, except for a minor spill of 110 liters during a prototype testing. Water consumption from November 2019 until October 2020 was 148 309 944 liters for 29 Gurit Group sites world- wide. In the previous year, the comparable figure was 89 million litres. The increase can be explained by several factors. Gurit Italy PET Recycling, which represents more than","one third of the total water consumption, was acquired during 2019 and only 4 months were reported in the previous report. The Kitting site in Mexico was in startup in 2019 and therefore not in full production in the previous reporting period. In Indonesia, Gurit sourced part of its water supply from its own well, but in 2020, it shifted to one single source, the local utilities company. Further- more some errors and omissions were discovered in data reported in the previous year’s period. 2020* 2019* Water consumption (in litres) 148 309 944 89 084 391 ** Water consumption vs. sales (continuous operations) ratio 0.26 0.16 * 2019 corresponds to the reporting period 1.11.2018 to 31.10.2019, and 2020 corresponds from 1.11.2019 to 31.10.2020 ** restated due to unit of measurement errors in previous report N GRI 303-5 Water consumption N GRI 303-4 Water discharge Water consumption “Being an operations manager,","one of my responsibilities is Environment, Health and Safety management.

Our site in Falces, Spain has re-designed their packaging of core kits that are delivered by truck to wind turbine blade manufacturers. The new packaging allows us to fit more kits onto one truck, saving 61 truck journeys per year, and saving 6 600 kg of plastic wrap to be replaced with a simple strap. Additional initiatives concerned our site","in New- port, UK. Formulated product boxes were redesigned to eliminate unnecessary single-use plastics such as tape and blister packs. In 2021, Gurit will be implementing new containers which are lighter, reducing the packag- ing weight by 74%, optimised in size, reducing empty volume by 22%. “We have a clear target: we want to reduce our carbon and plastic footprint in all our processes. We started a very exciting project with a customer where we optimise their transport and packaging. During 2021, this will avoid 61 truck journeys between Spain and Italy and save almost seven tons of plastic film.” Pablo Losa Site Manager Falces, Spain Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 97 Co-location for greener operations Less transport, less waste, more cus- tomer proximity As a supplier to the wind turbine market with wind blade tooling, composite materials and core kits, Gurit contributes along several steps of the value","chain with continuous improvements and innovations to further re- duce the overall cost of wind power. Gurit's co-location strategy is about reducing transport emissions, storage space, time and allowing for significant recycling of raw materials. The recipe is simple and effective: PET core material production sites, with extruders placed in the vicinity of kitting operations. Instead of weeks of sea-freight or long truck journeys, the locally produced Kerdyn™ Green PET structural foam cores are transported to the kitting factory next door – a five-minute journey using a forklift. This represents a huge reduction in transport emissions and the material can be processed much faster, speeding up the entire supply chain. Furthermore, waste from kitting operations can now be recycled back into the extruder, instead of disposing and transporting it to landfill or incineration. Also, instead of keeping large stocks at two sites, these can be reduced, dynamically optimised and managed.","The product properties remain the same at all sites globally, so in the event of a local shortage, the material can be sourced flexibly from an- other site.

A modern answer for a scalable synthetic core technology came with the adoption of thermoplastic extruded foam. In this respect, PET is the polymer that offers the greatest benefits in terms of the balance of thermal resistance (to withstand the production process), mechanical perfor- mance (delivering the necessary stiffness and strength) and cost. Moreover, PET offers a well-developed and resilient supply chain for recycled material, further improving the environmental credentials of a material and a production technology that already ensures great efficiency, allow- ing for any production waste to be recycled into fresh foam core material. ECOLOGICAL PANEL SOLUTION Sustainable structural core materials Bio epoxy and responsible packaging Sustainable fibre alternatives Low-toxity chemistry What are core materials? Structural cores come in many forms and are used in sandwich construction. The “sandwich” consists of a face skin laminate, the","core material, and the back skin laminate. The use of a core creates a laminate with greater elasticity (modulus) and stiffness with a minimum increase in weight. Sandwich construction allows the skins to carry the load, while the core material maintains the orientation of the skins. This form of construction has been a ba- sic component of the composites industry for nearly five decades and allows for exceptionally strong and light- weight structures for a variety of high-performance mar- kets including wind energy, marine, transportation and aerospace, among others.

Producing products from recycled plastics reduces energy requirements by 66 percent. In addition, Kerdyn™ Green reduces the environmental footprint by being used in wind and lightweighting applications in several other industries.” Luisa Gaiero Product Manager PET Recycled post-consumer waste Since post-consumer PET is widely recycled, there is an opportunity to utilise an already well-organised supply chain. Gurit recently","invested in the vertical integration of the recycling technology, beginning with the recent acquisition of a PET recycling business in Italy. Gurit Italy PET Recycling specialises in the recycling of PET bottles and the production of recycled PET flakes and granules later used for extrusion of recycled PET core. This allows Gurit to secure quality and cost-effective raw material supplies for its PET strategy, deepen its know- how of this specific material supply, and link the value chain elements starting from the recycled bottle down to a finished quality core, Kerdyn™ Green. By co-locating its manufacturing and kitting facilities, as Gurit is now doing in Mexico and India, the company also has the ability to give a second life to industrial PET waste. Following its manufacture, the structural PET foam plates move to the adjacent kitting site. In the sub- sequent kitting process, PET is cut to fit the size","and requirements of various customer projects. This cutting process generates waste, which would normally have to be disposed of. However, by co-locating extruders next to the kitting operations, this waste material can now be directly recy- cled in the adjacent extruder. This reduces overall costs while minimising waste and transportation emissions. The sustainability aspect of this process, along with Gurit’s vertical integration of the entire procedure, has become of significant interest to many in the marine in- dustry who are thinking more about the ecological im- pact of their business.

Brunswick is now the world’s leader in recreational boats, marine en- gines, and marine parts and accessories. Gurit’s Kerdyn PET structural foam is now used in their structural core applications, decks and parts. As part of its dedication to Sustainability, Brunswick has begun the transition from wood core used for added hull rigidity in many of its boats towards Gurit’s Kerdyn™ Green PET structural foam, made of up to 100% recy- cled plastic bottles. Several of its boat manufacturing fa- cilities have completed the conversion, and the balance will be completed in 2021. When full conversion is com- plete, the replacement of its current core materials with Kerdyn in their boat production operations will consume the equivalent of over 4 million recycled plastic bottles and save 7 000 trees annually. “Our transition to Gurit’s Kerdyn™ core was seamless and the material processes","beautifully. It also helps to achieve our long-term sustainability goals.” Sean Minogue Advanced Manufacturing Manager, Brunswick Boat Group/ Boston Whaler 103 Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 Because balsa wood is low in density but high in strength, it is preferred for use as core material in the composites industry; most notably, the blades of wind turbines. How is balsa grown? Balsa is known as a pioneer tree species, which means it is one of the first tree species to sprout naturally when there is a soil disturbance or clearing in the forest. Bal- sa trees grow on farms and in agricultural areas where small landowners and farmers have in balsa an addi- tional livelihood support. Most balsa wood comes from small landowners and rural families living in the agricul- tural frontier landscape. Balsa’s native range is from Central to South America However, Ecuador’s location and unique climate create the","perfect conditions to give Ecuadorian balsa the best physical and mechanical properties for the composite industry. As a pioneer species, balsa’s biological function is to provide protective cover so that other vegetation can grow. This is why balsa is so fast-growing and its wood is so amazingly lightweight. Given balsa’s rapid growth, it also has a short life span, of between 20 and 30 years, although the composite industry prefers balsa of around five years old. Balsa, a wood with excellent properties End-grain balsa wood has exceptional properties such as strength and stiffness, while being a sustainable option to utilise as core material. This material is pro- duced by gluing lumber along the direction of the fibres, which creates a robust block. The block is then sliced perpendicular to the fibre direction, creating core panels that are then employed to build resilient structures. The production of balsa core follows the","natural growth cycle of the trees, which is approximately four years, before reaching the point where the wood can be harvested. Thanks to this natural process, the trees are allowed to absorb carbon dioxide during their full growth cycle. The wood waste from the production process is utilised as alternative fuel for the kiln drying process within Gurit’s factory and adjacent ones in Ecuador, which reduces both waste and CO2. Balsa is a self-generating species which means that it renews itself quickly with a low risk of depletion. Gurit’s Balsa production centres are locat- ed in Ecuador and Indonesia. Finishing is done in Ecua- dor or China and from there, exported all over the world. Balsa wood – a naturally-grown core solution Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 104 Sustainable local business development In Ecuador, balsa farming has been a traditional family business activity for several generations. It has high","potential positive impact for farmers’ livelihood while also being a sustainable material for core material solutions. Most balsa wood comes from small landowners and rural families on the agricultural frontier. Towards a sustainable supply chain Gurit aims to foster a sustainable supply chain by in- cluding in its suppliers organisations such as the mis- sion-driven Whole Forest/Verdecanandé forestry enter- prise to establish and manage balsa farms with local families and manufacture laminates for Gurit’s global composite supply chain. Through this intervention, Whole Forest has grown to employ 100 community members in forestry, manufacturing and business ad- ministration, and works with over 400 small providers. In the past, Gurit has supported local communities and farmers with funding and plant donations to support local forestry businesses from an environmental, economic and social point of view. Gurit has also cooperated with authorities and academic institutions in Ecuador researching and defining the best practises","for managing, maintaining and harvesting Balsa. 105 Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 Lead forester, Darwin Rosero, delivering Balsa saplings to local community women Balsa supply chain “Balsa is being planted on soils with agriculture or livestock used for several generations for families’ livelihood. Gurit has been part of this business for over a decade, contributing to the creation of shared value where we operate. Our wide offerings within the wind market provide us with a great opportunity to be a true partner to the industry on its journey to sustainability. This is an exciting challenge, and I am proud to be a part of it.” Mara Ferrari Quality Manager, Gurit Balsa PLANTATIONS Balsa tree growth ROUGH SAWN TIMBER Harvest, saw and transport BLOCKS Block manufacture PANELS Panel manufacture Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 106 Gurit supplies a range of reinforcements suitable for composite component manufacture and repair. These","materials are based on the most widely used fibre types and fibre orientations, and incorporate a variety of construction techniques in their manufacture. Fibre- reinforced composite typically consists of three compo- nents: the fibres, a matrix and an interface. Natural fibres reduce the CO2 footprint by 50-75% Along with traditional glass- and carbon-fibre products and hybrids, Gurit has started to offer natural flax fibre products. Thanks to the flax-based reinforcements, the CO2 footprint of semi-structural composite parts, e.g. exterior panels, can be reduced by 75% when com- pared to carbon fibres while matching performance. For interior panels, weight can be reduced by up to 50% and plastic by up to 80% at matching performance. The combination of Gurit’s low toxicity bio resin with natural fibre solutions now provide an important first step for a bio-based composite panel solution for multiple indus- tries. These nature-based products are also viable from a","sustainable economic perspective: when compar- ing the performance of flax fibres with more tradition- al glass fibres, flax fibres have higher specific stiffness than E-glass. Furthermore, flax fibres have high vibration damping and good breaking properties which means that they do not produce sharp shards in the event of impact or structural failure of the component. In terms of cost, flax fibres are effectively positioned between carbon and E-glass. Examples of flax fibre materials distributed by Gurit are two lines developed by the Swiss partner company Bcomp: ampliTex™, a flax fibre fabric; and powerRibs™, a solution for stiffening thin-walled structures inspired by the veins on a plant leaf. Sustainable fibre alternatives ampliTex™ technical fabrics powerRibs™ reinforcement grid “The challenge to deliver truly sustainable products without compromising on cutting-edge performance is perhaps the greatest challenge composites have faced so far. With Gurit as a key player in this push for change,","it is an extremely exciting time to be a part of this innovative industry.” Kevin Cadd Product Manager Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 107 Sustainable chemistry at Gurit means that many factors are reviewed, such as ensuring that our manufacturing processes are safe and efficient in terms of resources used and emissions caused, as well as considering bio-based options, the use of recyclate and minimising material waste. Bio-based chemistry does not always mean new prod- ucts, but it does challenge the status quo. Gurit is working closely with its suppliers in order to revise the existing supply chain for existing products in order to achieve an increased bio-based content. Gurit aims to deliver bio-based chemistry as standard, for new and existing products. Sustainable chemistry balances a multitude of inputs: looking at toxicity, health & safety, transportation, sus- tainable supply chains and greenhouse gas emissions, with the ultimate goal of","creating a product that per- forms up to expectations. There is a broad spectrum of sustainable options currently available, although many are still in their infancy. For selecting the appropriate and most sustainable option, Gurit makes use of the growing sources of data such as lifecycle analysis and carbon footprint analysis, but our experts are aware of the vast amount of work still achievable in this area. An example of bio-based chemistry Gurit has success- fully introduced into the market is AMPRO™ BIO. It has an accredited 40-60% bio-based content and is a sim- ple to use, all-purpose epoxy. AMPRO™ can be used for gluing, coating, laminating and filling for a very wide range of tasks, most typically for the manufacture and repair of wooden boats. Bio-based chemistry: bio-content without compromising performance Gurit AMPRO™ BIO Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 108 Efficient wind turbine repairs The wind turbine repair","industry is growing due to the high number of existing wind tur- bines approaching an advanced age in their service life and in need of more frequent maintenance. It is vital that wind farms are kept in optimum working condition to ensure they are running at the highest energy generation capacity. Furthermore, these increases in efficiency streamline costs for the turbine owners and supply more energy back to the grid. For these reasons, regular preventative mainte- nance is commonly carried out, increasing the demand for materials and repair solu- tions for on- and offshore wind turbine gen- erators around the world. Maintenance extending the service life Wind turbines are typically designed for a service life of around 20 to 25 years. During this time, maintenance and repair procedures ensure the ongoing structural in- tegrity of the wind turbines and prevent catastrophic fail- ures. Problems need to be detected and repaired","as fast as possible to keep downtime to an absolute minimum. According to CompositesWorld.com, an out-of-service turbine can cost between USD 800 and 1 600 per day, with most repairs taking one to three days. If a crane is required to repair or replace a blade, the cost can run up to USD 350 000 per week. For an offshore turbine, a rough cost estimate for a 10 MW turbine standing still is about 10 000 EUR per 24h of lost income. Blade damage can occur from handling, installation, weather conditions and environmental impacts. Deteri- oration during operation is most common, with lightning strikes, debris, wind and constant temperature changes battering the wind blades, causing blade surface ero- sion, critical bonding areas to start separating or even more compromising damage to the composite struc- ture. Any of these critical components will likely render the turbine inoperable for some time and","the current repair solutions are critically impacted by temperature and humidity, reducing the repair teams’ access to the turbines throughout the year. Repair time reduced from two days to four hours Efficient repair solutions contribute to minimizing down- time, for example through materials availability, pro- cessing and applied properties. Gurit has a range of OEM-qualified & certified low-toxicity epoxy materials for all in-factory blade finishing and repairs, including Repair works on a wind blade Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 109 laminating and infusion resins, fillers, adhesives and gel- coats. Building on in-depth understanding of the materials from which wind blades are made, Gurit has developed new solutions for in-field maintenance that act to extend the lifecycle of wind turbine blades. Gurit offers a wide range of products available in two curing techniques: thermal & UV light. For example, the Ampreg™ low toxicity, ther- mally curing laminating system is supplied","in a range of dispensing solutions and small packs, ideally suited for use in challenging situations. Gurit’s UV-curing technology-based RENUVO™ moves from a two-day operation using thermal solutions, to a four-hour operation using a new-generation UV lamp. This saves on up-tower trips, enables several repairs in less time and reduces cure time from hours to minutes. The added health and safety benefits include less sys- tems handling and limited risk of spillage. Modern UV lights have become compact and lightweight, so today UV-curing is an attractive option for both in-field and in-factory repairs. Gurit wind blade repair portfolio: – Ampreg™ Laminating – PRIME™ Infusion – Filling & Fairing – Spabond™ Adhesive – Gelcoat Repair System – UV-Curing RENUVO™ The repair portfolio applies to a wide range of repairs, from blade-finishing or bonding of ancillary or retrofit- ting of parts, either in the factory, where the de-molded blade can require some","finishing, or repairs to in-field situations on the turbine in operation. A dedicated team at Gurit consisting of technical specialists, product developers as well as a worldwide distribution network with dedicated partners is being built up to address various stakeholders’ needs. “With an increasing share of wind rotor parks now reaching an advanced age, the industry is looking at solutions targeting increased average operation efficiencies and extending equipment life. Our experience across all aspects of the blade manufacture makes Gurit the prime partner for OEMs and wind park operators for the development and delivery of solutions during the whole blade life.” Mathieu Cariou Director Strategy & Business Development Wind, Gurit Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 110 Reduction of waste and in particular, addressing end-of- life concerns is one of the most prominent areas facing composite materials at present and one that Gurit is ac- tively engaged in research to","resolve. It is also one that has multiple potential solutions and requires the align- ment and engagement of the whole supply chain; in the example of wind blades, the material suppliers, blade producers, farm operators, maintenance contractors and decommissioning entities all need to work together to establish an integrated solution. When considering end of life, whilst we often think of recycling, there are other preferred options in the hierarchy of waste reduc- tion that can be considered. Firstly, elimination of waste. Here we can consider ways to prevent or prolong the need to dispose of redundant materials and compo- nents. Improving reliability and longevity through more robust materials and repair solutions, such as Gurit’s RENUVO™ and wind blade repair product ranges are one way to achieve this. Secondly, the reuse of com- ponents either through re-powering or re-purposing for other applications such as pedestrian bridges, road- building or the construction","materials industry is also an option. Gurit’s extensive database of material properties and engineering data supports this approach. Finally, the topic of recycling materials needs to be addressed. The challenges of recycling The paradox that needs to be solved with composite re- cycling is the fact that composite materials used in wind blade production need to be extremely durable, able to withstand harsh environmental conditions over decades of use. Such durability requirements do not instinctive- ly align with materials that are biodegradable or easily recycled. One solution to this is mechanical recycling, whereby blades are broken down into smaller fragments using mechanical “shredders”. Drawbacks with this ap- proach are that the shredded material is of lower value and a suitable end-user stream for the material needs to be found to avoid committing to landfill. In addition, this approach does not allow the reclamation of higher-value blade components such as carbon","fibres. Another op- tion is thermally re-formable composites such as ther- moplastic materials. This approach has the potential to facilitate a circular economy through the ability to form new fabrications or in the case of more complex shapes, separate higher-value components such as fibres to cre- ate a segregated approach to circularity. Current limita- tions of this technology that need to be addressed by research in this field, however, relate to the often very high temperatures, pressures and cleaning processes to truly reclaim thermoplastic matrices from the reinforc- ing fibres. As such, the recycling process is in practice somewhat theoretical and offers no or minimal net bene- fit in either economic or environmental cost over existing recycling approaches available to thermoset compos- ites. Likewise, whilst the re-forming of fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composites is viable for relatively flat structures, this becomes very difficult or impossible for more complex fabrications such as wind","turbine blades. Technology to address end-of-life wind blade concerns PREVENTION RE-USE REPURPOSE RECYCLING RECOVERY DISPOSAL Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 111 Research in reversible resin systems Another approach involves “reversible” or “unzippable” resin systems. This is an area where Gurit is investing in research, and principally involves developing the back-bone chemistry of the resin matrix such that when placed in specific conditions or stimuli, the cross-linked structure which is responsible for providing the resin properties are “reversed” or, to use the analogy of a clothes fastener, “unzipped” allowing easy separation of resin matrix and fibre reinforcement on demand. The advantages of this approach are that all the benefits of a cross-linked thermoset composite are retained, name- ly, the high mechanical properties, good environmental stability and resistance to creep, yet allows for recycling on demand without the need for very high temperature and pressure processes. The external stimuli or condi-","tions required for reversing the resin matrix are such that they are never encountered during the lifecycle of the blade (so as to ensure lifetime longevity and reliability of the blade in operation) yet are economic and efficient enough to enable a recycling process at end of life which is simple, economic and scalable allowing a net environ- mental benefit and hence sustainable solution. Single material products Wind turbine blades are mixed material fabrications. They are not made from a single material, instead con- sisting of glass and carbon fibres, resin systems, natural and foam core materials, adhesives as well as coating and paint systems. As such the successful application of an end-of-life solution needs to consider all of these elements holistically. There are two main approaches to this problem. One would be to ensure that the whole product is constructed of the same material group. In this manner, the","entire component or blade could be re- cycled as a single entity. The challenge to overcome with this approach relates to the fact that different areas and components of a blade require different material proper- ties and therefore a material which is universal. Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 112 “Truly addressing end-of-life concerns of composite structures requires the integration of many factors within the lifecycle of a component. The development of recyclable resin systems in isolation is not enough to provide an industry solution. Instead we need a suite of materials that can be repurposed or recycled. Innovation is required to allow wind blades to be separated into waste streams at end of life, and finally, the segregation and recycling processes must be both financially and environmentally sustainable. Such an approach must continue to maintain the economic, performance and reliability requirements necessary for blade design.” Paul Spencer Product Development","Manager, Gurit A second approach is to engineer the structure and ma- terials to allow them to be economically separated at end of life into different waste streams that can then be individually recycled. It is of little benefit for example, to have an in-principle, recyclable glass fibre blade skin if the coating and adhesives it is connected to are either not recyclable themselves or require a different recycling process. Smart materials Designing smart materials which can allow easy sepa- ration and segregation of blade components into indi- vidual waste streams, but importantly, only at point of end of life, is integral into any blade recycling technology. Again, Gurit identifies this as a key part of the problem and therefore forms part of our vision to addressing end- of-life concerns.

These ro- tor sails are a modernised version of the Flettner rotor, which takes advantage of the Magnus effect to generate aerodynamic force and assist in propelling the","vessel forward. A Flettner rotor is a smooth cylinder with disc end plates which is spun around on its long axis. It works to gen- erate aerodynamic force through the effect of the wind. As the wind meets the rotor the airflow accelerates on one side of the rotor sail and decelerates on the oppo- site side. This change in the speed of airflow creates the Magnus effect which results in a pressure difference. This difference in turn creates a lift force perpendicular to the wind flow direction helping to propel the vessel, increasing its fuel efficiency and reducing the shipping industry’s carbon footprint. Lightweight composites reviving the Flettner rotor The idea of a Flettner rotor on a ship is not new, first being trialled in 1924. The concept was proven viable but back then it took an inefficient amount of energy to turn the 15m tall metal cylinders and","was largely dis- continued. Today, thanks to the much lower weight of the cylinders due to cutting edge advanced composite materials and technology, Norsepower has revisited this concept, proving successful in reducing fuel costs by 5-30% and CO2 emissions by the same. The rotor was produced using Gurit’s environmental- ly friendly structural PET core, Kerydn™ Green, which is produced using up to 100% recycled materials, as well as PRIME™ 27 epoxy infusion system, Spabond™ 340LV adhesive, and the Ampreg™ 31 epoxy laminating system. Today, various tanker, cargo and cruiship ves- sels are already operating with rotor sails.

Norsepower, Comaxel and Gurit are proud of this recognition of their successful cooperation and innovative solution to lowering carbon emissions of the maritime transport sector. 114 Gurit","Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report How does a Rotor sail work? When wind conditions are favourable, the Rotor Sails allow the main engines to be throttled back, saving fuel and reducing emissions while providing the power needed to maintain speed and voyage time. A variable electric drive system, which is powered by the ship's low voltage network, is used for rotating the Rotor Sail. When wind meets the spinning Rotor Sail, the air flow accelerates on one side of the Rotor Sail and deceler- ates on the opposite side of the Rotor Sail. The change in the speed of air flow results in a pressure difference, which creates a lift force that is perpendicular to the wind flow direction.

In 2021, a dedicated workgroup on Equality and Diversity will be set up and identify potential areas of action regarding the enhancement of diversity and the identification of any discrimination in respect of employ- ment and occupation. N GRI 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken Gurit Annual Report 2020 Sustainability Report 122 Responsible supply chain Our various supply chains are a vital part of our business, providing us with resources to operate. Sustainability must cascade down the entire value chain, in terms of the environment, so- cial standards, but also regards to eco- nomic","performance to guarantee com- petitiveness and business continuity. In terms of our greenhouse gas emis- sions, we currently estimate that our supply chain generates more than two- thirds of our footprint, both in terms of materials and services purchased, as well as the related transportation. The most significant contribution stems from carbon fibre, a material requested by our customers and currently difficult to replace due to its specific properties. Furthermore, different criteria need to be evaluated and prioritised, for ex- ample: is it more important for us to source locally and avoid transport emissions, or do we give preference to a bio-based material with longer transportation routes? In 2021, Gurit will set up a workgroup to further analyse its supply chain and related impacts, and how to monitor and promote social, environmental standards, among other criteria. Supplier Standards Supplier standards of the Gurit Group are formalised in writing in Gurit’s","general Terms and Conditions. Obliga- tions explicitly referred to are the compliance with envi- ronment, health & safety laws as well as anti-corruption laws and human rights. A Modern Slavery Statement is available on the Gurit website: www.gurit.com/About/Sites--Locations/Site-Certficates “The largest part of our greenhouse gas footprint is in our supply chain. For me, a sustainable supply chain combines ethically, socially and environmentally responsible practices with economic and sourcing reliability considerations.” Andreas Kipker Member of the Executive Committee ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY / LOCAL COMMUNITIES PROCUREMENT COMPETITIVENESS/ DUAL SOURCING Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 123 Supplier Audits Gurit assesses and monitors suppliers for compliance with the Group’s Code of Conduct, standards and regula- tions. This monitoring is done by the Global Procurement department in collaboration with the Regulatory Com- pliance Officer. Supplier audits are carried out on a risk basis during the reporting period. The Global Procurement department carries out an","ethical audit as part of a supplier selection process. A formal supplier approval process exists and as part of that, a supplier categorisation tool which is used to rate suppliers and categorise the audit requirements. The tool supports the management of suppliers by defining audit requirements. The Supplier Quality Engineer also conducts sustainability audits. Supplier Non-Compliance Supplier non-compliance is controlled at site level and Non-Conformity-Requests (NCR) reports, scorecards and supplier evaluations are carried out as a result. The process differs by site but in 2019, a process was initiated to bring these into line in 2020. N GRI 102-9 Supply Chain N GRI 204 Procurement Practices Human rights Gurit strives to be a good corporate citizen in the local communities in which we are active. No complaints regarding infringements of Human Rights or issues related to Child Labour were brought forward to the Chairman of the Audit and Corporate Governance","Committee in the reporting period. No legal actions were proceeded or pending, and no fines or non-financial penalties related to non-compliance. Overall compliance with the Code of Conduct is subject to selected internal audits. Furthermore, the Executive Committee submits an an- nual report on compliance to the Board of Directors. General Terms and Conditions of contracts generally include a reference to Gurit’s Code of Conduct and related commitments to Human Rights and the rejection of Child Labour. The Global Procurement Team has not identified suppliers at significant risk of child labour, forced labour or human rights infringments and no incidents were reported. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, travel activity has been kept to a minimum: this includes visits to suppliers and business partners. Staff are trained on Gurit’s commitment as part of a mandatory internal electronic learning course on the Code of Conduct. Gurit adopted a new Sustainability Policy in","December 2020 and dedicated workstreams will review the need for additional action, audits or trainings throughout 2021.

Nine sites reported financial assistance given to local communities in the form of donations for earthquake victims, child vaccinations, hospitals and red cross institutions. Some sites also provided in-kind donations in the form of seeds or safety equipment. The focus of Gurit’s general","sponsorship commitments is the support of research and development activities in the advanced composites industry, mainly via sustainable ventures, academic institutions and composites-related student projects, as well as industry events, within the Group’s target markets. When deciding which projects and activities to support, emphasis is placed on sustainability as well as high ethical and moral standards. The amount of sponsorships provided in cash or in-kind in the form of composite materials amounted to CHF 90 707 during the November 1, 2019 to October 31, 2020 reporting period. N GRI 102-12 Extenal initiatives N GRI 102-43 Approach to stakeholder engagement Membership of associations Gurit and some of its subsidiaries participate in local and national organisations as well as industry associations. The individual involvements, however, do not constitute strategic memberships or imply substantial funding beyond rou- tine membership fees. Gurit sites reported a total of 42 memberships of associations, as compared to","32 in 2019. The main categories were composites industry associations, national employer associations and memberships in chambers of commerce or similar associations. N GRI 102-13 Membership of associations Collective bargaining Gurit grants its employees freedom of association and recognises this as an international human right. Gurit com- plies with all relevant local rules and legislations regarding employees’ freedom of association and the right to collective negotiation. No complaints, concerns or violations were reported at any of the Group's global sites or the Whistleblowing hotline in 2020. Gurit subsidiaries have reported to have maintained or entered into seven different collective bargaining agreements.

This documentation is used for local tax audits. This also applies to transfer pricing of cross-border, intra-firm transactions. Gurit is listed on the Swiss stock exchange and reports its financial fig- ures according to Swiss GAAP FER accounting stand- ards. These standards provide a true and fair view of the results of operations, cash flows and the financial situ- ation. Gurit does not maintain legal entities in offshore low-tax jurisdictions. N GRI 207-1 Approach to tax Tax Governance A tax governance and control framework exists in the form of internal guidelines and accounting manuals that are also used for tax audits with authorities. Gurit’s Audit and Corporate Governance Committee consists of","non-executive members of the Board of Di- rectors. It assists the Board in its supervisory financial duties and checks the effectiveness and performance of the external auditors. It also oversees the financial re- porting processes within the Group, including taxes. The Chairman of the Audit and Corporate Governance Com- mittee acts as an independent contact for any concerns and advice on the Gurit Code of Conduct; this includes unlawful behaviour and threats to the company’s integ- rity in relation to tax. N GRI 207-2 Tax governance, control and risk management Compliance with Laws During the reporting period, Gurit has not identified any non-compliance with laws or regulations in the social and economic area. No incidents of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations were reported by the sites.

Risk management: We conduct risk assessments to analyse and evaluate financial, environmental, social, operational and reputational risks. We continuously monitor and reduce the probability and financial impact of","our top ten business risks.

We continuously monitor our quality performance and seek to improve our non-conformity requests (NCRs) annually. Resourcefulness: We use all our resources in the most effective way possible to achieve objectives as outlined in our strategies. We make efficient use of resources, energy and capital. Innovation: We foster innovation and encourage the development of intellectual property. 135 Sustainability Report Gurit Annual Report 2020 Gurit embraces the understanding that doing business built on dependable environmental practices is essential to financial success with customers, investors, and the global communities in which we operate. We acknowl- edge the value of sustainability not only in regard to our own responsibility to the environment, but also to our customers who strive for a more responsible solution to manufacturing.","Our objective is to serve our customers with solutions that meet their own sustainability goals, and as such we will continue to achieve economic suc- cess in our markets by providing materials that fulfill our customers’ own objectives for environmental responsi- bility. Customer focus Gurit supplies a global customer base from manufac- turing and distribution sites in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Ecuador, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition, Gurit maintains partnerships with distribution partners worldwide. Types of customers range from small family enter prises to large multinational corporations and OEMs of the global wind turbine industry. \"Customer focus\" is one of our core values and bringing the best value to customers has been a priority for Gurit since the very beginning. To achieve this target, Gurit supports its global customer base in achieving their performance and","cost-reduction targets and in deriv- ing many benefits from the transformation of traditional structures into lightweight and durable solutions. On- site technical support, as well as product and process training related to the correct and safe handling and use of the Group's products, form an essential part of this aim. Distributors are included in these training activities as part of the Group's overall customer health and safe- ty efforts as their knowledge and advice plays an impor- tant role in regions where Gurit is not represented by local sales and technical support offices. Resourcefulness Gurit has adopted “Resourcefulness” as a key company value. Gurit is working in very competitive industries. We want to achieve the agreed goals by using our resources effectively. Economic performance “Sustainability is part of our vision and our financial health provides the foundation for a sustainable performance over the long run.” Philippe Wirth CFO Gurit Annual","Report 2020 Sustainability Report 136 Quality Gurit maintains Quality departments at all production sites and operates management systems to monitor and manage quality and the delivery of products ac- cording to customer specifications. In monitoring quality, Gurit aspires to achieve an On-Time-In-Full (OTIF) rate of 99% for its confirmed deliveries. Due to the high market demand and raw material shortage, this value was far below Gurit's ambitions and was only achieved by two business units. In 2020, Gurit achieved an OTIF rate of 95.5%, with the ambition to further improve in the future. Co-location strategy to reduce net working capital Gurit's co-location strategy delivers a wide range of benefits, ranging from reduced transportation and re- lated emissions, to a significant reduction of waste and increased use of recycled materials. In economic terms, this translates into significantly lower costs and a reduc- tion of net working capital, as the material reaches","the customer much faster, instead of spending days in stor- age and transportation. Co-location – aligning manufacturing footprint to market needs \"Our engineering team spent more than 3 000 hours on designing a large mold for wind blade tooling.

The reporting period is the 2020 cal- endar year as well as the previous two years where such data is available. For operational reasons, the reporting period for sustainability indicators such as education & training, greenhouse gas emissions, electricity and waste, has been set to November 1, 2019 – October 31, 2020. Unless otherwise specified, the data covers all locations of the Gurit Group, excluding any parts of the business listed as “discontinued” in Gurit’s financial statements. For some indicators, the scope of data collection was substantially widened during 2020. For greenhouse gas emissions reporting, some fig- ures contain data that has been calculated based on assumptions that were deemed appropriate - by either internal experts or the contracted South Pole external greenhouse gas consultancy – for","the intended use of reported information. Gurit has just started its green- house gas accounting on a best-effort basis. The quality of data and reporting is expected to improve over time. The data in the Sustainability Report has not been exter- nally verified. Gurit will be looking into further improving its sustainability data collection & reporting system, as well as related training over the coming years. Gurit publishes its Sustainability Report 2020 available as a separate document and in parallel as a chapter of its Annual Report 2020. Both the Annual Report and the Sustainability Report contain cross-references and should be consulted together.

Dedicated external stakeholder engagement systematically takes place with Shareholders at the An- nual General Meeting. Engagement with the financial community took place at two media & analyst conferences, various roadshows and conferences. Further stakeholder expectations and interests are systematically taken into account. Primarily, this covers information regarding customer needs and expectations gathered through face-to- face meetings and customer surveys, as well as technical conferences, trade shows and participation in trade asso- ciation events. The close and frequent communication of senior management, customer support, technical support and the sales organisation with customers and distribution partners facilitates a regular dialogue. Furthermore, Gurit has participated in industry events and conferences covering innovation, advances in material sciences and market developments. In 2019, Gurit conducted a Brand perception survey in the form of telephone interviews with customers and sup- pliers and via an online survey of over 150 employees. The","findings have been discussed in a workshop with the Executive Management and were taken into consideration for Gurit's new Vision, Mission and Values introduced Group-wide starting in January 2020.

The new Sustainability Policy","will be rolled out during 2021. N GRI 103-2 Management approach Implementation of this policy will require effort from multiple sources within the company, from the Board of Directors to Site Managers and committees. The Board of Directors will be responsible for reviewing the sustainability strategy on an annual basis. Following that review, the CEO and Executive Committee (EC) will define and control the strat- egy, determine appropriate means of execution, set targets and measure outcomes. The CEO and EC will update the Board quarterly on their work. Next, Business Unit Managers will oversee the implementation of the strategy within their unit, with Site Managers having responsibility for local enactment of the plan, to include KPI reporting monthly to their BU Manager, along with quarterly and annual updates. A Sustainability Manager for Gurit has been appointed; it is this individual’s re- sponsibility to coordinate implementation and reporting across the company,","complete ESG rating questionnaires, and compile the annual Sustainability Report. At the same time, cross-functional committees work on standards and KPI setting, reporting, and provide support to BU sites. These committees send quarterly progress statements and recommendations to the EC. Dedicated officers across the company overseeing the Health & Safety, Environ- ment, and Data Protection aspects of the strategy, work at BU and site level based upon site-specific needs, Group standards, and ISO certification requirements.
