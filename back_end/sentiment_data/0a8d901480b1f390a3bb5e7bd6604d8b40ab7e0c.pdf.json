We have included a message from our President & CEO, Gordon Stothart, and an update on","our 2019–2020 Targets and Achievements. President’s Message Gord Stothart President and Chief Executive Officer We have also undergone some significant organizational changes since 2019. With Steve Letwin’s decision to retire in Q1 of 2020, I took over the role of President and CEO of IAMGOLD. I joined IAMGOLD in 2007 and as COO, oversaw all aspects of operations and project development. I strongly believe in IAMGOLD’s safe operational culture and commitment to Zero Harm. The organizational changes I have made since taking office reflects my desire to bolster our organizational commitment to sustainability and Zero Harm. 2019 put the organization","in a strong position to weather a tumultuous year globally in 2020. IAMGOLD’s corporate and site teams have done a remarkable job in ensuring business continuity at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. This year, the pandemic has shown us why our commitment to excellence in ESG is so important. At the outset of the pandemic, our operations were given the dual challenge of business continuity and supporting our host communities and governments. Within a few weeks, we marshalled our resources and made a commitment of US$1.5 million in additional community support on top of our existing community investments. With","a combination of in-kind donations and monetary support, our contributions ranged from bolstering food security, donating medical equipment and PPEs to bolstering COVID-19 aid funds. We have outlined the details of our support in this year’s UN Sustainable Development Goals report. The impact of COVID-19 has driven home for many how fragile our economies and societies are to certain risks. In that context, we would be remiss if we did not address the risks presented by climate change. IAMGOLD has spent the last few years steadily reducing our carbon footprint with investments in renewable energy at our operations. As an","industry, the fight against climate change requires us to prioritize responsible energy use, maximize efficiencies, and explore strategies towards carbon neutrality. At IAMGOLD, discussions have begun in earnest on a path forward on achieving carbon neutral status as we position the business for a post-carbon economy. We have recently assembled an ESG committee comprised of senior corporate executives, senior operations management and corporate sustainability leads to develop a definitive action plan with set targets. Our goal is to have a preliminary plan in place by the end of 2021. Also in 2020, recent events in the US and elsewhere have","sparked global protests calling for greater justice and fair treatment for those who are underrepresented, impoverished and marginalized, particularly because of their race. At IAMGOLD we unequivocally condemn inequity, discrimination and hatred in all its forms and this is reflected explicitly in our Values: that we conduct ourselves with respect and embrace diversity. To put concrete actions in place to back up these words, we have established a working group led by the Executive Leadership Team, but incorporating a spectrum of individuals from across the organization, to consider Diversity and Inclusion at IAMGOLD. 2019 was an exciting year for IAMGOLD.","We focused on operational improvements, advancements of engineering and further de-risking of projects while maintaining and strengthening our balance sheet. At Westwood, we aligned our cost structure with production levels. We delivered the first ore from the Saramacca deposit to the Rosebel Mill, thereby positioning Rosebel for a strong future. At Essakane, we announced positive results from the Carbon-In-Leach and Heap Leach Project feasibility study. This feasibility study produced a robust, low cost plan with optionality in the future which will be integrated into the Essakane optimization review that is currently underway. Our exploration team has done an outstanding job","of maintaining a strong pipeline of projects. Their efforts were recognized by the Quebec Mineral Exploration Association for Discovery of Year for the Nelligan project in 2019. IAMGOLD CORPORATION 2019 HEALTH, SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure Affordable & Clean Energy No Poverty Good Health & Well-being Overview & Governance President’s Message Clean Water & Sanitation Quality Education 1 Targets & Achievements Health and safety is core to IAMGOLD’s relentless pursuit of our Zero Harm vision. To maintain a healthy and safe workplace, we know it is about more than just policies and procedures- it is about building","a culture of health and safety alongside our employees and promoting local community health and well-being. We continue to implement the Mind- Body-Achievement (MBA) program, Version 2.0, at all of our sites. In 2019, we were able to improve both the Total Recordable Incident (TRI) and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) metrics from 2018. We ended 2019 with TRI and DART rates of 0.87 and 0.51, which represents a decrease of 23% for each indicator from 2018. Our overall Lost Time Incident (LTI) rates increased by 8% from 2018. Unfortunately, we did have a fatality at Essakane in 2019.","This incident acts as a sobering reminder that despite our progress to date, which has been significant, we cannot afford to be complacent. At both Rosebel and Westwood, significant improvements have been made in key health and safety metrics by both operations with both TRI and DART rates trending down from 2018. Essakane’s DART and TRI rate did increase by 40% and 54% respectively. Overall, year over year, our performance in key health and safety indicators are trending downwards, and thus far, 2020 should be one of our best health and safety performance years yet. In 2019, there was an","unfortunate incident on our Rosebel concession in 2019 involving local police and unauthorized artisanal miners which resulted in the death of an unauthorized miner. Following the event we temporarily suspended mining activities while we worked with government authorities to investigate the incident and ensure proper mitigation measures were in place to prevent future incidents before resuming operations. Earlier this year, Rosebel, the Government of Suriname, the Traditional Authority of Nieuw Koffiekamp, Makamboa and Kamp Mining NV, signed a joint letter to start work in the East Tailings Road Resource and the Roma East Protocol. With these agreements, a legal basis","has been established to allow a maximum of 500 small scale miners from Nieuw Koffiekamp to work in these two locations in the Gross Rosebel concession. We view this tragic incident as an important reminder of our collective responsibility to work tirelessly to prevent such incidents. With the establishment of a comprehensive framework, clear and operation communications, allowance of small scale mining on our concessions, and the Rosebel Community Fund to support socio-economic development, it is our sincere hope to see all parties working in harmony going forward. At IAMGOLD, we take our license to operate very seriously. At both","Essakane and Rosebel, we have committed to funding the establishment of community funds. Going forward, the bulk of our funding for community investment initiatives will flow through these dedicated community funds, which have been established to ensure consistent funding on a year-to-year basis, thereby avoiding uncertainty with annual budgetary reviews. This is a particularly important change in the context of a highly cyclical industry like gold mining. The Rosebel Community Fund was officially launched in October 2019, with an endowment of US$2.5 million from IAMGOLD. IAMGOLD has further committed to making an annual contribution to Fund, in order to make","it sustainable over time. IAMGOLD finalized its participation in the Mining Fund for Local Development in Burkina Faso, which was established by the government. As part of our agreement, we have contributed US$4 million to the Fund, with a commitment to ongoing annual contributions going forward. I am also taking this opportunity to publicly commit to implementing the World Gold Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles (RGMP), as a complement to our ongoing commitments under the Mining Association of Canada’s Toward Sustainable Mining (TSM) initiative. We will be publishing our inaugural RGMP report in the fall of 2020, which will outline","our ongoing gap assessment and an implementation timeline. At Côté, we celebrated the signing of an impact and benefits agreement with Mattagami and Flying Post First Nations in the spring of 2019. This provided us with a strong foundation to move forward with the project, culminating in a positive construction decision by the Boards of IAMGOLD and Sumitomo in the summer of 2020. From the early days, we have committed to a collaborative approach to running and managing the Côté Gold project. As well as employment and environmental initiatives, a detailed socioeconomic management and monitoring plan is being co-developed with","local First Nations to monitor the impact of the mine on neighbouring communities. This plan will be co-owned and co-managed by both Mattagami and Flying Post First Nations and IAMGOLD. Oversight and implementation will be provided through a joint environmental management committee. “ Health and safety is core to IAMGOLD’S relentless pursuit of our Zero Harm vision. To maintain a healthy and safe workplace, we know it is about more than just policies and procedures – it is about building a culture of health and safety alongside our employees and promoting local community health and well-being.” IAMGOLD CORPORATION 2019 HEALTH,","SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2 Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure Affordable & Clean Energy No Poverty Good Health & Well-being Overview & Governance President’s Message Clean Water & Sanitation Quality Education Targets & Achievements At Essakane, we celebrated the end of Phase 1 of the Triangle D’eau project. IAMGOLD, in partnership with the Government of Canada, Cowater and One Drop, invested US$17.4 million in building and upgrading water infrastructure as well as promoting proper hygiene practices. IAMGOLD is actively working to identify partners for a phase 2 of this initiative to extend the water infrastructure beyond Dori to two other communities","proximate to the Essakane mine. IAMGOLD’s approach to sustainability reflects the nature of our business. Capital-intensive industries such as mining can only earn returns over long time periods. It is critically important that our business is oriented in securing and maintaining our social license to operate over that same time horizon. Doing so requires sustained and consistent investment in programs to identify, manage and mitigate the impacts of our activities, while at the same time ensuring impacted communities and stakeholders benefit from our operations beyond the legal minimum and with initiatives that can endure and deliver benefits well beyond the","life of the mining operation. IAMGOLD has a long corporate history of sustainability-oriented operations and part of our operational resiliency is rooted in strong sustainability practices. It is ingrained in our organizational culture to support a strong CSR program. We have consistently been recognized as a top corporate citizen and we take pride in sustainability. As the new President and CEO of IAMGOLD, I am recommitting the organization to our core vision of Zero Harm. Our commitment to continually strive to reach the highest standards of human health and safety, minimize our impact on the environment and work co-operatively with","our host communities.

IAMGOLD has implemented an implementation committee with representatives from IAMGOLD and from both Mattagami and Flying Post First Nations. The implemenation committee meets monthly to ensure the Impact and Benefits Agreement is being executed as negotiated and intended. Any issues with the implementation process can be","raised during the meetings and IAMGOLD representatives are able to resolve it prior to the following meeting. Continue permitting in support of the Côté Gold Project in Ontario. Significant milestones have been achieved in 2019 and 2020 in securing key permits for the project. Since 2018, we have secured the Leave to Construct from the Ontario Energy Board, Forestry Resource License, Schedule 2 of the Fisheries Act, Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, Environmental Compliance Approval for Construction as well as authorizations under the Canadian Navigable Waters Act. Several other significant permits are outstanding at the provincial level from the","Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks. IAMGOLD expects to receive approval for these permits in 2020 and 2021. Secure mining permit to support development of the Boto project in Senegal. Our operations are designed with our commitment to responsible operating practices and compliance with legal requirements in mind. Responsible productions means striving to reach the highest standards in human health and safety, minimizing the impact on the evironment and working cooperatively with our host communities. IAMGOLD secured the mining permit in 2020. Update closure plan for Essakane. Every mine has a finite","operational life and its eventual closure can contribute to significant social, economic and environmental changes to the receiving enviroment: flora and fauna and host communities. It is critical that all our sites have updated closure plans to ensure social and economic priorities and concerns are integrated into the plan. Essakane closure plan was finalized and will be submitted to the Burkinabe government for approval in late 2020. Initiate ESIA for a potential biomass project at Rosebel Gold Mine. The fight against climate change ultimately requires our industry to prioritize responsible energy use, improve efficiencies, and explore new options for fuel","switching and renewables. IAMGOLD is working at both the global and local level to advance these priorities and to reduce our carbon footprint. The ESIA for a potential biomass project was put on hold as we investigate other renewable technology options. Continue implementation of the Mind Body Achievement program by Axiom in order to increase health and safety awareness at all our sites. To maintain a healthy and safe workplace, we know it is about more than just policies and procedures – it is about building a culture of health and safety alongside our employees and promoting local community health","and well-being. We have continued implementation of the Mind Body Achievement program at all of our sites. Health and Safety peformance has improved across the organization since 2018 and we expect 2020 to be a strong year for health and safety perfomance across the organization.

Through our partnerships with governments and civil society, we are working hard to advance the UN SDGs. At each of our mine sites, our CSR program is led by the community relations team in coordination with site management, as well as by the corporate HSS and senior leadership teams. Community initiatives are designed to address the needs and priorities of host communities and are identified by engaging with the host communities themselves. Investments in community initiatives","vary in size, funding and impact. We target large scale investments towards community legacy projects that are designed to advance the UN SDGs by increasing the resiliency of our host communities. We also invest in small scale community projects to increase local skills through training and education. At our sites in Burkina Faso and Suriname, as of 2019, the bulk of our community funding now flows through dedicated foundations which have been established to ensure consistent funding on a year-to-year basis, thereby avoiding uncertainty with annual budgetary reviews. This is a particularly important change in the context of a highly","cyclical industry like gold mining. IAMGOLD’S 2019 HSS report outlines many of the key initiatives we have undertaken to ensure our Company leaves behind a positive and sustainable legacy. Health and safety is a priority for IAMGOLD in any given year but especially so this year. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a wide range of challenges to both our employees and our business. While the impact and global proliferation of the pandemic is unprecedented, IAMGOLD has a robust management system in place to navigate crises and respond to these challenges. Specifically, the Corporate Crisis Management Plan and respective site-level crisis","management plans are triggered to support IAMGOLD in successfully responding to major incidents through internal procedures that mitigate impacts to the business, our operations and to our people. In the context of COVID-19, crisis management measures to prevent, control and respond to transmission of the virus are based on rigorous internal protocols and best practices from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada. IAMGOLD invests in community initiatives that adhere to the following criteria: baseline information provided on health, education and economic indicators; demonstration of a participatory approach to decision- making on community investment; identification of","civil society, government and community partners to help deliver community development objectives; and a project evaluation procedure and measured results. The operational and logistical realities of the pandemic and its impact compelled IAMGOLD to create, reinforce and adapt processes and procedures, reassess organizational norms and establish new ways to execute and fulfill objectives. Site-level challenges, mandates, legal environments, operational contexts, risk exposure and thresholds are assessed and management plans deployed, reinforced and monitored on an ongoing basis. Specific COVID-19 measures have been implemented across various business functions, including business continuity, health and safety, human resources, supply chain and logistics, government","and community relations, security, finance, communications and IT.

Advancing community healthcare: In 2019, in addition to our initial US$1.35 million investment in Suriname healthcare, Rosebel mine invested additional funds to further improve community access to high-quality healthcare: Rosebel supported a dental care initiative to provide preventive and curative care to primary school pupils in local communities near the mine. This initiative, in partnership with the Youth Dental Care Organization","– Jeugd Tand Verzorging (JTV) – enabled 1,500 students to learn about basic dental hygiene, and where necessary, curative care was performed including extractions and teeth filling. In partnership with the Medical Mission on Primary Health Care and the Mobile Eye Care Mission, IAMGOLD funded a one-day eye care clinic in the community of Brownsweg, while creating a registry of participants from nearby communities for future clinics. Two patient monitors were donated to the intensive care unit of the Pediatric Department of the Diakonessenhuis Hospital and a steam sterilizer was donated to the Sint Vincentius Hospital. As part of Rosebel’s","Christmas Charity event, the mine raised US$25,650, which was donated to 19 different organizations in Suriname dedicated to taking care of seniors, people with special needs and orphans. Fighting Anemia: There is a high prevalence of childhood anemia in Peru, with 42% of children having suffered from this blood disorder. In the Ayacucho region, where IAMGOLD has exploration activities, the prevalence rate is actually 48%. In order to help combat this issue, the IAMGOLD Peru team implemented a food and nutrition health program – aimed at pregnant women and women with children under the age of 3 – in partnership","with the local municipality, local public health authorities and local NGOs, PAIS and Juntos. The program aims to improve eating habits by providing nutritional counselling workshops to combat the prevalence of anemia in the region. Approximately 30 local women have benefited from the program to date. Medical missions in Nicaragua: Since 2016, IAMGOLD has partnered with the Ascenta Foundation to conduct medical missions in the Riscos de Oro area of Nicaragua. The Ascenta Foundation is a registered Canadian charitable organization focused on promoting health and well-being by providing urgent medical, dental, optometric and surgical services to medically underserved communities. A","team of 101 individuals provided medical, optometry and dental care to over 2,300 patients over a period of a week in May 2019. Patients with visual acuities were assessed and fitted for corrective lenses, with over 1,000 patients in total assessed. The team also provided both restorative and preventative dental care, treating 225 patients and performing 192 extractions and 168 fillings. Medical assessments ranging from prenatal care and family planning considerations to dermatological care was provided for over 2,000 patients. Blood transfusion: In 2019, our Essakane mine in Burkina Faso formalized a partnership with the National Center for Blood Transfusion.","Essakane donated approximately US$10,000 to the Center and organized a number of blood drives at the mine site to collect blood donations from employees. To date, over 200 bags of blood have been donated to the National Center. Promoting awareness: Essakane partnered with local associations working on a campaign to create awareness of diseases prevalent in the local communities. The aim of the campaign was to stimulate a change in behaviour toward preventing diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and childhood malnutrition. The program involved five health districts and benefited 29 villages and 61,000 residents.

In Canada, IAMGOLD supports a number of academic programs that encourage students to pursue a career in mining. We support the Toronto-based Young Mining Professionals Scholarship Fund. For the 2019/2020 academic year, the IAMGOLD Women in Mining Scholarship provided funding to two exceptional women enrolled in mining-related programs. Annually, we provide financial support to the Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award, a self-development program for 14 to 24-year-olds. Our commitment extends to 2024, which will help expand the program to","the Gogama-Sudbury-Timmins region of Northern Ontario and a focus on Indigenous and marginalized youth. IAMGOLD’s contribution of C$2 million over five years is directed toward the construction of a “collaboration” space for engineering students at Laurentian University’s Cliff Fielding Research, Innovation, and Engineering Building. The IAMGOLD Engineering Student Junction was officially unveiled in April of 2019. The endowment will also be used to support lab refurbishments, technology and equipment upgrades, research and scholarships. In Suriname, over the past few years, the community relations team at Rosebel mine has supported students from the rural district of Brokopondo by organizing a variety","of personal and professional development courses. In the summer of 2019, 60 students were given training in resume writing and mock job interviews. In addition to interview prep, the Brokopondo Scholarship Program, funded by IAMGOLD, offers scholarships to graduates from the district of Brokopondo to support students transitioning from high school to post-secondary education in the capital of Paramaribo. Since 2009, a total of 48 students have joined the scholarship program and four have successfully obtained their bachelor’s degrees in the fields of education, public administration, history and business administration. An additional five students are expected to graduate from the","program in 2020, while IT student Rai Paulus (originally from the Rosebel-related community of Brownsweg) successfully completing his internship at the Rosebel mine in April and has since been hired on as a full-time employee of the Company. IAMGOLD is also providing five years of funding support to the Anton de Kom University of Suriname for its Green Partnership Program. The program runs until 2022 and is dedicated to advancing the sustainable management of natural resources. In Burkina Faso, our Essakane mine invested close to US$20,000 to implement a program aimed at increasing adult literacy in the regions of Gorom-Gorom","and Falagountou. In partnership with the Falagountou Basic Educational Unit, our funding enabled 10 centres to open and teach 210 adults how to read. Multiple evaluations completed throughout the year show an 80% success rate in achieving adult literacy through the program In Quebec, IAMGOLD renewed our partnership with the Research Institute of Mines and Environment (RIME) at UQAT Polytechnique in Abitibi. Our contribution – totalling C$2.1 million over the 2020–2026 period – will enable RIME’s research program on developing sustainable progressive reclamation solutions to continue and develop further. In Peru, there is high environmental degradation in the local villages","near IAMGOLD’s exploration program. Notably, there are inadequate facilities for disposal of solid waste or recycling waste and rampant deforestation. In 2019, the IAMGOLD Peru exploration team implemented an environmental education program aimed at 500 students and teachers in the community. The awareness campaign focused on disseminating messaging on the proper disposal of solid waste, the effects of deforestation and climate change. The campaign also encouraged participants to reuse and recycle waste as well as to plant trees. Under lockdown due to the pandemic, remote learning is not a reality for many Peruvian students. Only 28% of households in Peru","have access to the internet and 34% to a computer, laptop or tablet. In the community of Totora, the situation is even more critical as due to the nature of the location, the community does not have a strong internet connection and access to television and radio signals are restricted. Our IAMGOLD Peru team implemented a satellite internet service to help students connect online and continue their schooling. A total of 83 elementary students, 69 secondary students, and 20 post-secondary students have taken advantage of this service.

Phase 1 was completed in 2019 and we are actively seeking funding for Phase 2 of the project. The project has built the necessary infrastructure for drinking water and latrines in a number of towns and villages – which typically includes a water intake facility, a pumping station, a water treatment plant and a 12-kilometre water pipe system with the capacity to provide safe and reliable water access. The project also improved household sanitation facilities and provided institutional gender-specific sanitation facilities. Once all the phases are complete, this project will","ultimately benefit over 100,000 people, providing access to safe water to approximately 60,000 people in the town of Dori and sanitation infrastructure to approximately 40,000 people in the towns of Falagountou and Gorom-Gorom. IAMGOLD and our partners will continue to expand the program, with Phase 2 providing safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure to more than 250,000 people. This next phase – which will scale up to C$32.7 million through new funding from IAMGOLD and One Drop – will support the government and people of Burkina Faso in managing this essential resource. No one should be without access to safe","and reliable water, and we are proud to be a part of a project that will continue to improve people’s lives in rural Burkina Faso. “ IAMGOLD is one of the key players in the private sector committed to doing this right, and we are proud to be collaborating with them in Burkina Faso.” Marie-Claude Bourgie Chief Development Officer, One Drop Click here to learn more about the One Drop Foundation.

We work with our host communities to upgrade roads and expand","local access and mobility. In Peru, the remote communities near our operations face poor conditions for roads that connect to the nearest cities of Puquio and Nasca. Last year, our Peru exploration team hired a local company and local labour to upgrade 18 kilometres of gravel road. This has improved connectivity to nearby cities and as a result, has had a positive impact on the local economy. In Burkina Faso, similarly, our Essakane mine has invested in the maintenance of local roads to facilitate access to nearby villages. In 2019, in partnership with the Ministry of Infrastructure and under the","supervision of its technical services, IAMGOLD made a financial contribution of US$1.3 million to rehabilitate 45 kilometres of road between the town of Dori and the Essakane mine. By year-end 2019, 60% of the work had been completed and the remainder will be completed by 2020. 45 KM of road upgraded or rehabilitated in 2019 in Peru and Burkina Faso.

We","commissioned the 15.12 megawatt peak (MWp) photovoltaic (“PV”) plant in 2018, which will supply Essakane with competitive and carbon-free electricity for years to come. Made of close to 130,000 photovoltaic panels, the solar plant produces approximately 27 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity per year. Over the next 15 years alone, the Essakane Solar plant is expected to displace 86 million litres of heavy fuel, save US$81 million in fuel costs, and avoid 274,110 tonnes of CO2 emissions. As of December 31, 2019, Essakane Solar exceeded expectations by saving approximately 5 million litres of fuel and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by","approximately 15,586 tonnes. PROVIDING BETTER ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE VIA SOLAR: Essakane invested over US$200,000 to install 263 solar panels and 104 batteries in the Dori Regional Hospital. This initiative has increased the energy autonomy of the hospital, as well as the patient level of care, because the hospital now enjoys uninterrupted power. In addition to the installation of the solar electrification system, the Essakane mine also invested in upgrading the hospital’s air conditioning system and other equipment such as electric vacuum cleaners, incubators, oxygen concentrators, etc. IAMGOLD recognizes that mining activities are energy intensive and generate significant greenhouse gas (GHG)","emissions. The fight against climate change ultimately requires our industry to prioritize responsible energy use, improve efficiencies, and explore new options for fuel switching and renewables. IAMGOLD is working at both the global and local level to advance these priorities and to reduce our carbon footprint. We have invested extensively in solar infrastructure at both of our Suriname and Burkina Faso operations. We also promote the use of solar power at our exploration projects. Essakane solar/thermal facility Maximizing Essakane Solar’s socio-economic impact IAMGOLD prioritizes local employment and the transfer of valuable know-how and professional skills that bring value to our","local stakeholders. We have worked to ensure that local communities benefit from the Essakane Solar project by providing various employment, training, business and economic development opportunities, while reducing the region’s dependence on refined fuel products and to hedge against volatility in electricity pricing. We have created significant direct and indirect employment and training opportunities, during both the construction and operating phases of the Essakane mine, including hiring approximately 75 people from nearby communities during construction and creating 40 permanent operating jobs over the next 15 years at the solar-thermal plant. IAMGOLD has used this project as a vehicle to support","local economic development by investing 1% of project revenues in community development projects, in alignment with IAMGOLD’s CSR strategy and targets. To date, revenues from Essakane Solar have been invested in reforestation initiatives in nearby villages, as well as toward training of village forest management committees. So far 600 trees have been planted with the ultimate goal of planting 950 trees in the forest of Falagountou. Furthermore, IAMGOLD has committed to the extensive purchase of local goods and services across our supply chain to support and maximize contributions from local businesses and create sustainable industrial clusters in support of future","socio- economic development in the region. We anticipate that Essakane Solar will attract other investments to the region, which will further promote local economic development, provide opportunities for local companies to expand their business, and help stimulate the economy. Additionally, benefits will accrue to the government through taxes paid during the life of the Essakane mine.

Previous IAMGOLD President and CEO presenting a cheque for $2.5M to the Rosebel Community Fund. In order to safeguard community investments from the cyclical nature of the gold mining industry, as of 2019, the bulk of our funding now flows through dedicated foundations in Burkina Faso and Suriname, which have been established to ensure consistent funding on an annual basis.","The Rosebel Community Fund was officially launched in October 2019 with a donation of US$2.5 million from IAMGOLD. The Fund’s primary objective is to contribute to sustainable development by collaborating with stakeholders in a structured manner. IAMGOLD is committed to making an annual contribution to the Fund, in order to make it sustainable over time. IAMGOLD finalized its participation in the Mining Fund for Local Development in Burkina Faso, which was established by the government. As part of our agreement, we have contributed US$4 million to the Fund, with a commitment to ongoing annual contributions going forward. Supporting small-scale miners:","In 2019, the Rosebel mine spent over US$260,000 to implement the Roma East Protocol. The protocol ensures access to the Roma east pit for small-scale miners. The funding allows for the purchase of equipment to assist in accessing ore, and providing technical guidance and support for overall water and pit management. Rosebel’s Youth Development Program initiative is designed to build capacity within young people between the ages of 10 and 18. The program aims to increase the overall employability of youth by providing in-house training for them to become heavy equipment operators. This program provides an avenue for youth, particularly","young men, to gain employable skills and provides an alternate career path away from small-scale mining. To date, 23 participants have successfully completed the training and have obtained employment at Rosebel mine. Creating new job opportunities: IAMGOLD provided funding in 2019 to train 40 young small-scale miners at the National Agency for Employment (ANPE) in the community of Dori in Burkina Faso. The program included 60-day training programs in both metalworking and carpentry and two-month internships at our Essakane mine. The training aims to offer job integration opportunities and create opportunities for young people in the region to leave artisanal","small-scale mining. IAMGOLD also worked with a group of local farmers to produce rice in the Gourouol Basin – an area that is not ideally suited for rice production – using supplementary irrigation and adapted farming methods. The program focused on training women and small-scale miners and in two years, with an initial investment of US$17,500, the group produced 10 tonnes of paddy rice and 12 tonnes of forage. Thanks to this project, over 67 small-scale miners are now rice producers, with enough production to ensure food security in local households and communities. Training female entrepreneurs: In 2018, women from","different communities near our Rosebel mine in Suriname were offered various sewing courses. For those who completed the courses, Rosebel provided various procurement opportunities. For example, the mine purchased goods from these women in 2019 ranging from mosquito nets for the exploration team to PPE wear; while the women’s manufacturing unit supplied a total of 7,000 cloth masks to the Rosebel workforce that same year. In 2020, Rosebel partnered with Global Impex, an established global PPE-wear supplier, to provide previously trained community women with internship opportunities at one of Global Impex’s local factories. Once the women complete their internships, Global","Impex will provide funding for them to set up manufacturing facilities in their local communities. Ultimately the goal is to ensure these women-run facilities are self-sufficient, with the mine acting as an anchor tenant and the business would become their primary source of income. 13 women have been trained by Rosebel mine through various sewing courses. They now supply the mine with a range of goods from mosquito nets to PPE wear IAMGOLD CORPORATION 2019 HEALTH, SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 23 Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure Affordable & Clean Energy No Poverty Good Health & Well-being Overview & Governance President’s Message","Clean Water & Sanitation Quality Education Targets & Achievements Recovering scrap metal to finance female entrepreneurs – IAMGOLD’S IRON FUND: The Essakane mine launched a scrap metal recovery program in 2017 – known locally as Fonds Fer or Iron Fund – to help fund business ideas, with a particular focus on supporting women entrepreneurs. The Iron Fund uses the revenue from auctioning the mine’s scrap metal and other reusable waste materials to fund local business ideas that serve pressing community needs, create new revenue streams and contribute to sustainable socio- economic development in the region. To date, the Iron Fund","has supported a total of 119 projects worth US $250,000. Best practices in funding local businesses: The mining industry, particularly in developing areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, often faces challenges as they relate to the employment and economic empowerment of young people and women. Through the Iron Fund, IAMGOLD has developed a novel and effective approach that is the first of its kind in the mining industry. The project has helped mitigate the adverse effects surrounding unemployment and lack of decent work in the area. It can be easily replicated by other companies, particularly those engaged in metals and mining,","as well as other heavy industry sectors. The mobilization of funds for the recovery of recyclable metal (and other) waste, in dialogue with host communities, is a feasible commitment for all miners. It makes it possible to integrate the challenges of socio-economic development, while taking into account the principles of best practice recycling strategies. Microcredit program: IAMGOLD’s Essakane mine originally set up a microcredit program in 2015. In five years, the program has benefited 433 women through a fund of US$80,000. This fund enabled 69 women in local communities to access financing for their income- generating activities. To date, none","of the beneficiaries of the program have defaulted on their payments. Protecting biodiversity: Rosebel mine is located near the Amazon rainforest. Rosebel’s environmental department has conducted a wildlife survey of birds and terrestrial mammal species in the forest near neighbouring Surinamese villages of Nieuw Jacobkondre, Baling, Bilawatra and Misalibikondre. Rosebel’s environmental specialist is training local villagers to place cameras and detect GPS coordinates of camera locations in order to collect the recorded footage. The survey results will not only contribute to a better understanding of the wildlife in the area, it will also assess the local potential of eco-friendly tourism,","which can help the local economy tremendously. Honey production: The Colombia exploration team has established communal bee hives in five locations in the town of El Zancudo. First established in 2018, the five apiaries in operation now produce over 800 kgs of honey and are a significant source of income for 10 families. Through this program, 24 locals have received training and now work on the project. Students at the local school; an IAMGOLD funded initiative. Rosebel wildlife survey The Power of Peanut Butter One of the Iron Fund’s unique projects is a peanut butter production unit run by a","group of 11 local women entrepreneurs. In Burkina Faso, peanut butter is an essential ingredient, but it is traditionally produced manually, requiring a great deal of time and exhausting physical labour. Establishing this production unit has given communities around the mine reliable access to high- quality and affordable peanut butter, a critical commodity. The unit has quickly become a mainstay in the community: monthly production is estimated at 1,800 kilograms (kg) as compared to less than 100 kg per month of manual production. The business is growing fast, and the production unit is planning to hire more people, both to","process the peanut butter and to distribute it. It generates a monthly profit of approximately C$1,200 for the business, providing the 11 entrepreneurs and other women in the area with a legitimate mechanism for economic empowerment. While the unit’s primary customers are currently local households and restaurants, the Essakane mine is also a client. Eventually the potential market coverage is estimated to be 50 kilometres in radius and over 40,000 beneficiaries. The project also contributes to important local environmental stewardship priorities by harnessing the power of electricity, rather than wood fire, which is helping to safeguard local natural resources.
