Foreword 4 2022 progress 7 How we work 8 About this report 9 3 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Foreword Enabling sustainability for our company, our customers, and the world 2022 marked the sixth warmest year in history. Extreme weather caused devastating droughts, wildfires, famine, floods, and heat waves with alarming frequency. We felt the effects of climate change like never before, and as","the planet warms, we’ll continue to see and feel the negative impacts on ecosystems and communities around the world. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores the severity of the climate crisis, and the urgent need for global collective action. Meaningful climate action requires an enduring commitment from both government and business, with the private sector playing an increasingly important role in the transition from pledges to progress. As we reflect on the seriousness of the climate crisis, we have expanded our ambition to meet this urgent climate need by investing in a broad","range of initiatives, technologies and approaches that support a net zero future. As we look toward 2030—and beyond—we remain optimistic about our collective ability to decarbonize the global economy while continuing to grow and prosper as a global community. 4 | | | Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President Microsoft’s approach to addressing the climate crisis starts with the sustainability of our own business. In 2020, we made a bold set of commitments: to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company that protects ecosystems—all by 2030. Three years into this journey, we remain","steadfast in our commitment. 2022 was a reminder that to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change, our commitments need to extend beyond our four walls, and we must continue to accelerate investments that will enable progress for decades to come. In 2022 we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive suite of enterprise-grade sustainability management tools. We also helped to advance a set of global sustainability initiatives that aim to benefit every person and organization on the planet. These include accelerating the availability of new climate technologies through our Climate Innovation Fund, strengthening our climate policy agenda, helping","to develop a more reliable and interoperable carbon accounting system, advocating for skilling programs to expand the green workforce, and working to enable a just transition for the vulnerable populations of the global south. We believe that Microsoft has an important role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but also recognize that the climate crisis can’t be solved by any single company, organization, or government. The global community needs partnerships, new innovations, policies, and global commitment to ensure a healthy future for all. A closer look at 2022 Getting our own house in order Microsoft’s own sustainability","is our first sphere of influence, and we remain focused on getting our own house in order and delivering on our 2030 commitments. We made ambitious commitments in 2020 and we knew that progress would not always be linear. These commitments are rooted in science and take the necessary steps to protect our ecosystems and prevent the most severe impacts of climate change. We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. In addition to our long- term focus, it’s important to pause","and evaluate our progress in 2022. In 2022, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions declined by 0.5 percent. This in part is a result of a reduction in our direct operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 22.7 percent. At Microsoft, Scope 1 and 2 emissions account for less than four percent of total emissions, while indirect emissions, or Scope 3, account for more than 96 percent. Our Scope 3 reported emissions increased slightly in 2022, by 0.5 percent, despite a 25 percent increase in purchased goods and services due to business growth. The more positive","outcomes in 2022 are the result of improvements in our operations, real-time device telemetry-based measurement, renewable energy investments, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchases, and procurement of unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs). Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix While we continue to work to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero, Scope 3 is the ultimate decarbonization challenge. It necessitates the co- evolution of best practices for business, technology, and policy among thousands of global stakeholders. When we made our carbon negative commitment in 2020 it wasn’t just a challenge to support","the sustainability of our business, it was also an invitation to the world to participate in this journey, translating ingenuity into action, and action into impact. In addition to our carbon negative commitment, we’ve also made encouraging progress toward our 2030 commitments in water, waste, and ecosystems: Water positive We contracted for replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million m3 in volumetric water benefits, increasing our running total of replenishment projects to 35 million m3. Additionally, we provided more than 850,000 people with access to clean water and sanitation solutions, including 163,000 in Brazil, India, Indonesia,","and Mexico. We are firmly focused on achieving our 2030 commitments and making the right long-term investments that support the sustainability of our business for decades to come. Zero waste We increased our reuse and recycle rates of all cloud hardware to 82 percent and continue to pace toward our 2030 reuse and recycle goal of 90 percent. We also reduced single-use plastics across all Microsoft product packaging to 3.3 percent and are on track to eliminate their use by 2025. In total, we have diverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills. Ecosystem protection We continue to maintain","our commitment to protect more land than we use. In 2022, 12,000 of the over 17,000 acres of contracted land were officially designated as protected. The amount of land protected in 2022 exceeds the approximately 11,200 acres of land we currently use. Amplifying our impact and helping our customers achieve more Our second sphere of influence is customer sustainability. As a technology company, we have a role to play with the thousands of corporate customers who put their trust in Microsoft technology. The majority of our customers have already made a climate pledge and Microsoft is working to help them","move from pledges to progress. While Microsoft’s emissions footprint is a tiny percentage of global emissions, we also have a role to play in helping reduce or remove the other 99.97 percent of global emissions. It’s important that our approach to sustainability extends beyond our own four walls and supports the sustainability needs of our customers. Foreword (continued) Companies can only manage what they can measure, and Microsoft is committed to helping our customers measure their environmental impact in a timely and accurate manner. In June 2022, we launched Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, a comprehensive environmental sustainability management platform that","includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager. These new digital tools can interoperate with virtually any business system and unify data intelligence for organizations at any stage of their sustainability journey. Sustainability Manager enables organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Microsoft Azure customers also benefited from significant upgrades to the Emissions Impact Dashboard (EID), which helps customers to understand the emissions impact that results from their use of the Microsoft Cloud. The EID estimates Microsoft’s direct and indirect emissions related to a customer’s cloud usage, as well as the emissions customers have avoided by running workloads","in the cloud rather than on-premises. In 2022, we also released a preview version of the Microsoft Planetary Computer to enable customers to measure, monitor, and subsequently to manage ecosystems that may be affected by their operations, and to make important decisions related to climate risk. The Planetary Computer draws on more than 60 petabytes of open-source geospatial data. This data, when combined with the analytic capabilities of our AI for Good Lab, delivers a new level of planetary insights to corporations and governments around the world. Enabling and supporting a more sustainable world Finally, our third sphere of influence","is to impact global sustainability. Just as the reach of Microsoft technology extends to almost every country in the world, so should the impact of our sustainability programs. In November 2022, the world’s climate leaders convened for COP27. There were important conversations at COP27 focused on the uneven impacts of climate change and how the least developed countries in the world are disproportionately affected. For example, the nations of Africa together account for less than 5 percent of global emissions but have experienced far more than their share of the negative impacts of climate change. At Microsoft, we are focused","on climate policies and programs that will have a positive impact on all eight billion inhabitants of planet Earth. Policy Microsoft is deeply committed to using our voice to influence sustainability policies around the world. We support public policy initiatives to accelerate carbon reporting, reduction and removal, the transition to clean energy, water access and stress reduction, and the ability to measure, manage, and protect ecosystems. In 2022, we further committed to shaping public policy by releasing policy briefs on carbon and electricity. Carbon measurement and the Carbon Call In February 2022, Microsoft, ClimateWorks Foundation, and over 20 leading organizations","launched an important new initiative called the Carbon Call. The objective of this program is to unify the world around a carbon accounting system that is more reliable and interoperable. ClimateWorks Foundation is building this program to a global scale. The Carbon Call now has over 80 signatories, and released its initial roadmap at COP27. 5 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Climate Innovation Fund We believe that innovation is a critical component to solving the climate crisis, and that the investment of capital plays an important role in accelerating the","availability of new solutions. Microsoft is investing in accelerating climate innovation through our $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund (CIF). We invest in innovative technologies and business models that have the potential for meaningful, measurable climate impact by 2030. Since the founding of the CIF in 2020, Microsoft has allocated more than $600 million into a global portfolio of more than 50 investments, including sustainable solutions in energy, industrial, and natural systems. Africa data lab In November we announced an expansion of our AI for Good Lab into Egypt and Kenya, building a new team of data scientists on the ground","in Africa that will work to improve climate resilience. The work of these data labs will be informed by a new Africa AI Innovation Council comprised of representatives from leading African organizations. Sustainability skills Delivering on the ambition of the Paris Agreement will require a global initiative focused on the proliferation of sustainability skills throughout the labor market. In November 2022, Microsoft and BCG released a new report, Closing the Sustainability Skills Gap: Helping Businesses Move from Pledges to Progress. This report reinforces the need for employers and governments to invest in upskilling the current workforce through learning initiatives focused","on sustainability knowledge and skills, to prepare the next generation for sustainability jobs of the future. Microsoft is working with partners to develop and share new sustainability learning materials to accelerate the development of the sustainability workforce of the future. A decade of innovation and decisive action As we look toward 2030—and beyond—we remain optimistic about our collective ability to decarbonize the global economy while continuing to grow and prosper as a global community. We will continue investing in three key areas that will enable the scale of sustainability solutions needed to address the climate crisis: 1 Advancing AI solutions","for greater climate impact. 2 Accelerating the development of sustainability markets through investment. 3 Creating tools that advance emissions measurement and compliance. This will be a decade of innovation and decisive action, from expanding the use of AI to address sustainability to forging new public and private sector partnerships. To move from pledges to progress, we cannot be deterred by near-term challenges, and must remain focused on developing innovative new solutions and in many cases, accelerating our actions. At Microsoft, we’re deeply committed to sustainability as a company, as a technology provider, and as citizens of planet Earth.

Sustainability skills gap To better understand how to close the sustainability skills gap, Microsoft published the Closing the Sustainability Skills Gap report and LinkedIn published the Green Skills Report to provide insights into","the demand and supply of talent with green skills. Carbon 1.4M metric tons We contracted 1,443,981 metric tons of carbon removal in FY22. We also made first-of-a-kind multi-year forward offtake commitments to carbon removal, which we view as the model for scaling this industry. Water 15.6M m3 In FY22, we contracted for replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million m3 in volumetric water benefit over the lifetime of these projects. Waste 12,159 metric tons In FY22, we diverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills and incinerators across our direct operational footprint. Ecosystems 12,270 acres","In FY22, we protected 12,270 acres of land in Belize. We now protect more than the 11,206 acres of land that we use. 13.5 GW In FY22, we signed new PPAs around the globe, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5 GW, including projects in 16 countries and more than 135 clean energy projects. 1M By the end of FY22, we provided more than 550,000 people with access to clean water and sanitation solutions in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico and reached just under one million people by the end of the calendar year 2022. 82% Our","reuse and recycle rates of servers and components across all cloud hardware reached 82 percent in FY22. Big game migration program Through the NFWF Western Big Game Migration Program, we invested in projects in the American West that are vital for preserving the migration corridors of endangered and at-risk species, including mountain lions and grizzly bears. Scope 1 & 2 Our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions remained proportional with business growth in FY22. Environmental justice Environmental justice is embedded in our water access target, and we are looking for ways to be more intentional about integrating environmental justice into","our replenishment investments. 29% We reduced single-use plastics in our Microsoft product packaging by more than 29 percent, a decrease from 4.7 percent to 3.3 percent by weight (on average) of plastic per package in FY22. Protecting biodiversity Last year, we contributed to the TNC Belize Maya Forest Project (BMF) to protect an additional 236,000 acres in a global biodiversity hotspot. 7 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix How we work For any organization’s environmental sustainability journey, it is critical to set commitments, develop a strategy, and build an operational roadmap—all","while measuring progress and ensuring accountability. We’ve learned a lot over the last three years of Microsoft’s sustainability journey, and we hope that sharing our approach can help other organizations as they develop their own roadmap. 1 Set commitments based on science Sustainability science has been at the center of our commitments. In 2019, Microsoft took a step back to look at the science behind climate change and saw that our commitment to being carbon neutral was not enough. The world needs to reach net zero by or before 2050, and achieving it relies heavily on private sector partnership and","action. This guided us to make our commitments to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030. 2 Consider all positions of influence As a global technology leader, Microsoft has many opportunities to influence—as a customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate, and innovation partner. We know it will take commitment across our entire value chain to reach our goals. We also focus on the larger impact that we can have with research, investments, innovation, strategic partnerships, policy, and advocacy. 3 Establish sustainability as part of culture At the heart of the Microsoft culture is the belief that","for Microsoft to continue to do well, the world around us also needs to do well. As we continue to grow, we are pursuing opportunities that help solve the problems of people and the planet—and we have made sustainability core to our brand and our business. Our senior leadership team has a deep and enduring commitment to sustainability, which sets the tone across all levels of our organization. 4 Make it central to business To move from pledges to progress, Microsoft set commitments and built sustainability into the strategy, operations, and roadmaps of each business group and every subsidiary across","the globe. We are also working across our value chain on sustainability commitments and support our customers and partners by delivering capacity-building tools and solutions. 5 Ensure governance and accountability Governance and accountability are critical to ensure cross-company alignment and prioritization of sustainability commitments. At Microsoft, we hold our business groups accountable for their carbon emissions via an internal carbon fee. Achieving our sustainability commitments is a core priority for every business group; we publish scorecards twice yearly and review progress quarterly. We established a Climate Council of senior leaders across the company to govern our sustainability progress and priorities.","6 Report on everything, not just progress Transparency needs to be a component of any sustainability initiative. Microsoft is committed to sharing our progress, learnings, innovations, methodology development, and thought leadership through our annual sustainability report, white papers, blogs, and journal publications. We share playbooks from our successes, as well as learnings when we uncover new challenges or setbacks. These learnings also inspire us to champion global issues such as more reliable and interoperable global carbon accounting, a more systematic approach to building a multidisciplinary workforce of sustainability experts, and the development of innovative technology solutions for our customers and","partners. 8 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix About this report We think about Microsoft’s role in sustainability through three spheres of influence: Microsoft sustainability, customer sustainability, and global sustainability. Transparent and accountable reporting on progress A key principle of our work is transparency. This report, published annually, includes our strategy, progress against our goals, and key challenges and trends we see in this work. We also publish our environmental data, which is included in the separate Environmental Data Fact Sheet. Deloitte & Touche LLP performed a review relating to specified","information within Section 1 of the Environmental Data Fact Sheet. Amplifying our impact Microsoft sustainability Microsoft sustainability Taking care of our own environmental footprint Our sustainability work starts with getting our own house in order. We are taking accountability for our operational footprint and are committed to sharing learnings, accelerating markets, scaling solutions, and being transparent about our progress. Customer sustainability Customer sustainability Delivering digital technology for net zero We are committed to providing the digital technology needed to help build a more sustainable world. We are delivering technology to help organizations measure and manage their environmental footprints and monitor","the health of the planet’s natural ecosystems. Global sustainability 9 | | | Global sustainability Enabling a more sustainable world We understand that our actions alone will not solve the climate crisis. As a global technology leader, we are also committed to helping build the enabling societal conditions that will support a net zero economy. Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Read about how we report in Appendix A More on page 10 More on page 52 More on page 65 Microsoft sustainability Taking care of our own environmental footprint Our sustainability work starts","with taking accountability for our operational footprint. In 2020, Microsoft made industry-leading commitments to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030, and to protect more land than we use by 2025. This means taking accountability for our operational footprint across our campuses, datacenters, devices, software, and value chain. We look at our operations across the entire lifecycle of assets and products, from design to building, usage, and end of life. We are committed to sharing our learnings, accelerating markets, scaling solutions across our value chain, and being transparent about our progress.

Operationally, we see this commitment as a journey that starts with reducing carbon emissions as much as possible, replacing our electricity consumption with carbon-free energy, and removing the emissions that remain. In FY22, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions were down 0.5 percent. Our total company emissions were just under 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide","equivalents (mtCO2e) (market- based and management-defined criteria for Scope 3 Category 11). Taking into account our renewable energy purchases, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were approximately 428,000 mtCO2e. More than 96 percent of our emissions are in Scope 3, which includes emissions from our supply chain, the lifecycle of our hardware and devices, travel, and other indirect sources. We saw a 0.5 percent increase in our Scope 3 emissions this year based on investments in real-time device telemetry-based measurement, improvements in our operations and supply chain, and purchases of renewable energy. As the world transitions to a lower-carbon, clean","energy economy, we’re using our purchasing and investing power to help advance innovation and the development of new solutions—helping us meet our own commitments while catalyzing the creation of broader market supply for others. We fund purchases of renewable energy, sustainable aviation fuel, and carbon removal through our internal carbon fee, which we established in 2012. The fee is designed to accelerate carbon reduction and allocate funding to projects that jumpstart and scale decarbonization technologies. In FY22, we redesigned and increased our carbon fee to accelerate Scope 3 emissions reduction, tying the fee to the costs abatement for different sources—electricity,","fuel, and other emissions. We will continue to evaluate the carbon fee design to align our business operations and 2030 carbon commitments. In 2022, we were able to disaggregate and identify previously unreported electricity for some of our leased datacenters due to improvements in our ability to capture such data. We have revised FY20 and FY21 Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 3 market and location values to include this additional information. In FY22, we included this activity in our results and procured unbundled renewable energy credits (RECs) to mitigate the increased emissions for FY22. Our year-over-year figures show a","23 percent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions, which is driven in part by our procurement of RECs for FY22. Without this revision, our Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions would have remained proportional with business growth. 13.5 GW In FY22, we signed new power purchase agreements around the globe, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5 GW. 11 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Commitments and progress Carbon negative by 2030 We are committed to being carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050 remove from","the atmosphere an equivalent amount of all the carbon dioxide our company has emitted either directly or by our electricity consumption since we were founded in 1975. Our commitment Reducing direct emissions We will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by increasing energy efficiency, decarbonization, and reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. Reducing value chain emissions By 2030, we will reduce our Scope 3 emissions by more than half from a 2020 baseline. Replacing with 100/100/0 carbon-free energy By 2030, 100 percent of our electricity consumption will be matched by zero carbon energy purchases 100","percent of the time. Removing the rest of our emissions By 2030, Microsoft will remove more carbon than it emits. By 2050, we will remove an amount of carbon equivalent to all our historical emissions. Our progress Net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions Our Scope 1 and 21 emissions remained proportional with business growth in FY22.2 More than 95 percent of our Scope 2 emissions were reduced by renewable energy from power purchase agreements (PPAs), green tariff programs, and unbundled renewable energy certificates. Scope 3 emissions increased by 0.5 percent Our value chain or Scope 3 emissions increased slightly","at 0.5 percent, despite a 25 percent increase in purchased goods and services due to business growth. This result was driven by improvements in our operations, telemetry-based measurement, renewable energy investments, sustainable aviation fuel purchases, and procurement of unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs).3 13.5 GW of carbon-free energy In FY22, we signed new Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) around the globe, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5 GW, including more than 135 projects in 16 countries.

Building datacenters for optimum power usage effectiveness The power usage effectiveness (PUE) ratio is a metric","of how efficiently a datacenter consumes and uses energy. We design and build Microsoft datacenters as close to a PUE of 1 as feasible. Our newest generation of datacenters have a design PUE of 1.12 and, with each new generation, we strive to become even more efficient. In addition, all future built datacenters will be LEED Gold certified. We are also investigating how to encourage transparency and efficiency improvements at leased sites. Promoting grid stability via energy storage solutions Wind farms generate more than 35 percent of Ireland’s electricity. As the supply of wind and other renewable energy increases, electric","power grid operators need to ensure that they have resources available to balance variable power production. Banks of lithium- ion batteries at our Dublin datacenter, typically used for backup power, will help grid operators provide uninterrupted service when demand exceeds renewable supply—reducing the need to rely on coal or natural gas to support a stable grid. The uninterruptible power supply for the Dublin datacenter includes new technology that enables real-time provision of services to the grid. We’re also researching and testing alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, to address the challenges of high demand for raw materials and end-of-life disposal. Innovating with","thermal energy in our campuses As part of our Redmond Campus Modernization project, we built the Thermal Energy Center. Nine hundred deep wells are the foundation of a large system that heats and cools the new buildings. The wells will compose one of the largest geoexchange fields in the United States to take advantage of the temperature difference between sub-ground soil, which remains constant year-round, and that of ambient air, which changes with the seasons. More than 220 miles of piping will distribute 320,000 gallons of water as a heat-exchange medium across the wells and the new campus in a","closed loop system. The Thermal Energy Center houses chillers, cooling towers, backup generators, solar panels, and 65-foot tanks that can store thousands of gallons of water as thermal energy. The system is expected to reduce energy consumption by more than 50 percent of a typical utility plant. Designing energy efficiency into our campuses Our global campus projects adhere to strict sustainability standards which have energy efficiency measures embedded in our design requirements. All major projects must achieve LEED Gold or Platinum certification, ensuring high energy efficiency design. Each of our campuses has a sustainability plan with energy efficiency projects planned","each year to drive down our energy usage. Ensuring the energy efficiency of our buildings, including owned datacenters, is a key step in reducing our emissions. 15 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions (continued) Reducing fossil fuels Microsoft is committed to being diesel free in our datacenter operations by 2030, moving to all-electric kitchens, and electrifying our campus fleet. Developing hydrogen fuel cells for datacenters The decreasing cost of renewable sources, advancement of green hydrogen production technology, and increasing legislative focus are starting to show","potential to reduce the datacenter industry’s reliance on fossil-based diesel fuels. Microsoft is demonstrating the application of green hydrogen at industrial scales— with a first of its kind, zero emission, 3 MW hydrogen polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell back- up power generator piloted in July 2022. PEM fuel cell technology combines hydrogen and outside air in a chemical reaction that generates electricity, heat, and water. While hydrogen fuel cell technology has been commercialized at smaller scales, this is the first time it has been demonstrated for multi-megawatt generation needs at datacenters. This year, Microsoft opened our first all-electric kitchen","on our Redmond campus. The One Esterra food hall includes 12,200 square feet of all-electric cooking space, which supports more than 1,000 meals a day and uses 100 percent renewable hydro power. 100% We use 100 percent carbon-free energy in our first all-electric kitchen on the Redmond campus. We are reducing fossil fuels with our first all-electric kitchen, which uses 100 percent renewable power. Implementing all-electric kitchens This year, Microsoft opened our first all-electric kitchen on our Redmond campus. The One Esterra food hall includes 12,200 square feet of all-electric cooking space, which supports more than 1,000 meals a day","and uses 100 percent renewable hydro power. In collaboration with Jade Range, we created custom commercial grade electric cooking equipment. Moving forward, we intend to construct all new kitchens with all-electric equipment and are developing retrofit plans for existing operations. We released a new Dining All-Electric white paper sharing our lessons learned, technical details, and decision making. One Esterra is a preview of our Redmond Campus Modernization which will have over 77,000 square feet of all-electric dining operations and serve more than 10,000 meals a day. Electrifying our fleet We are committed to fully electrifying our global campus operations vehicle","fleet of over 1,800 vehicles by 2030. To date, we have received five all-electric buses in Ireland and sites in China are running all- electric routes through service providers. In Redmond, Microsoft purchased land to build an eight-acre electric vehicle charging and maintenance facility for its internal and external commute fleet of electric buses and shuttles. 16 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Reducing Scope 3 emissions Our Scope 3 commitment is our most powerful opportunity to help accelerate global decarbonization efforts by engaging suppliers and customers in our value chain","and partnering to reduce emissions associated with the business we do together. Microsoft’s Scope 3 emissions account for more than 96 percent of our total emissions, with the vast majority of these emissions coming from three categories: Purchased Goods and Services (Category 1), Capital Goods (Category 2), and Use of Sold Products (Category 11). Overall, our Scope 3 emissions increased by 0.5 percent in FY22 compared to FY21. This is attributed to a few notable carbon reduction initiatives. First, we’ve extended the useful life of servers and network equipment from four to six years, resulting in a decrease in emissions","related to Capital Goods. Second, we introduced a new telemetry-driven methodology to help us account for the energy consumption from our Surface devices and our rapidly growing base of Xbox users. This new data led us to purchase unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) to offset a portion of the emissions footprint from these devices. Just as is the case for Scope 2 reduction efforts, we plan to phase out the use of unbundled RECs in future years as programs to reduce emissions take effect, including substantial forward investments into new clean energy facilities yet to commence operation. Improving Scope 3","measurement and methodologies Accurate measurement is one of the biggest challenges in Scope 3 emissions reduction. Microsoft has prioritized improving the methodologies we use for collecting data and calculating emissions for greater precision and granularity. Increasing data quality from our supply chain Supply chain and capital goods are our biggest drivers of emissions, and we need better data in these categories to drive the right reduction strategies. In July 2022, we updated our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) sustainability requirements to include independent third-party assurance of emissions data and to deliver a minimum 55 percent greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction by","2030. Improving accounting methodologies For capital goods, we are developing new methodologies to use product specific emissions factors for building materials from the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3). This methodology is under development (not yet reflected in Scope 3 reporting metrics) and, in combination with using EC3 in project decisions to track and reduce embodied carbon at each phase of construction, will enable us to reduce embodied carbon emissions on our construction projects as well as demonstrate those product-level reduction decisions in future reporting cycles. Advancing lifecycle assessments Microsoft is promoting circular design principles for the cloud hardware and","devices communities. This year, we contributed to the “Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Guidelines for Cloud Providers” and provided the guidelines to the Open Compute Project (OCP) to encourage other cloud hardware organizations to better understand and reduce their environmental impact. We are also evolving our approach to LCAs in our devices. The LCAs will feed into an advanced Carbon Data Platform to provide the most representative emissions profile possible for our devices. The platform will be used for reporting and improved decision- making with visibility into actionable and granular environmental impacts. Optimizing devices based on real-world data We are using","real-world, anonymized insights from users of Surface and Xbox devices who opt to share information with us to inform our carbon emissions assessments. The data provides an estimate of how energy is consumed by those devices based on factors such as battery drain and CPU utilization. We use this data to calculate high-quality estimates of the daily energy use in different geographies. In the future, we are exploring how to increase accuracy by shifting to hourly energy use tracking paired with more granular, impact-relevant grid emission rate data. Microsoft has prioritized improving the methodologies we use for collecting data and","calculating emissions for greater precision and granularity. We are using real- world, anonymized insights from users of Surface and Xbox devices who opt to share information with us to estimate how energy is consumed by those devices. 17 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Reducing Scope 3 emissions (continued) Reducing emissions by consuming less Our top priority for reducing Scope 3 emissions is to design efficiency and circularity into construction and purchasing from the start, so our supply chain uses less energy. Improving efficiency to reduce the number of datacenters Datacenter","resources are often designed and built for peak power usage, which can lead to underutilization and the need to build new datacenters. Microsoft is focused on improving datacenter efficiency by reducing peak power, safely harvesting unused power, and increasing server density in existing datacenters through intelligent utilization, service level agreement (SLA)-driven power harvesting, and power-aware virtual machine allocation. We use the inherent redundancy in Microsoft-internal software services to tap into datacenter capacity that is traditionally reserved for use only during power grid or infrastructure failures, so we can increase the number of servers in datacenters by up to 33 percent","and, in turn, reduce the number of datacenters needed overall. Reducing embodied carbon in buildings and interiors To drive deeper reductions in embodied carbon, we are pursuing the use of transformational low-carbon materials. This year, we piloted a new concrete mix using recycled glass pozzolans, reducing embodied carbon for the slab structure by around half. We completed a lab-scale pilot of structural materials made from biogenic limestone and algae-based concrete, which have the potential to drive down embodied carbon of concrete installations to near zero. Microsoft also completed a study of embodied carbon emissions in furniture, carpeting, and other interior","building features to establish the baseline for reduction in our design standards. These standards, using the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3), set thresholds for mineral wool insulation, cold-formed steel framing, carpeting, and gypsum. Reimagining circularity of cloud hardware Microsoft has taken an innovative approach by implementing Circular Centers in our datacenter campuses, aligning our end-of-life dispositioning processes with an integrated plan across the entire supply chain. Over the past year, we engaged new suppliers who can remanufacture assets and components, enabling new lifecycles for our assets. We have demonstrated takeback/buyback models with several of our original asset suppliers, closing","the loop on assets and enabling suppliers to repurpose or reuse assets and components, resulting in emissions reduction and material recovery. Our Circular Center program will reuse or recycle 90 percent of datacenter decommissioned cloud computing hardware assets, contributing directly to emissions reductions. Engineering carbon out of our cloud operations and hardware supply chain We are focused on engineering carbon out of our value chain via the infrastructure equipment we use in the operation of our datacenters. Using LCAs and environmental product declarations, we partner with our suppliers to assess hotspots of embodied carbon in the equipment we purchase, so","we can better understand how we can help reduce emissions in our supply chain. In FY22, our cloud hardware designers worked with material and component suppliers to design components that reduced dependency on virgin plastic, introducing up to 35 percent post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic in select server components. We also redesigned certain rack components to drive material reduction, resulting in a reduction of plastic in those components by 12 percent. Boosting efficiency of device usage Surface Pro 9 and Surface Laptop 5 are among the most energy efficient Surface computers, and both are ENERGY STAR® Certified, consuming less than half","the recommended energy limit from the latest ENERGY STAR computer specifications.4 Surface Pro 9 5G, powered by ARM technology, combines the energy efficiency of modern mobile devices with the computing power of a traditional computer. We also use software to reduce carbon emissions associated with our devices’ use stage, such as with the energy-efficient Shutdown (energy saving) mode for Xbox, which cuts power use by up to 20 times when it is off, compared to Sleep mode. 90% Our Circular Center program will reuse or recycle 90 percent of datacenter decommissioned cloud computing hardware assets. Our Circular Centers contribute directly","to emissions reductions by reusing or recycling hardware assets. 18 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Reducing Scope 3 emissions (continued) Transforming the market through purchasing Through our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) and purchasing commitments, Microsoft is sending demand signals to our supply chain that we expect lower-carbon inputs and business models. Roadmapping our supply chain Since 2020, our SCoC has required that suppliers disclose GHG emissions and plans to reduce those emissions. Last year, we met with our top suppliers to understand their sustainability objectives and establish a shared","approach to how we measure emissions, establish baselines, identify difficult to reduce areas, and review commitments to align on the priorities. In the indirect purchasing space, including consultancies and marketing companies, suppliers are starting to consider policies for hybrid work and exploring options for how best to transition to renewable electricity. In FY22, we supported the avoidance of 28,000 mt of CO2e savings in partnership with our suppliers by shifting cargo from carbon intense modes (air and truck) to lower-carbon modes (ocean and rail). We partner with suppliers to shift to lower-carbon modes of transport, resulting in a measurable emissions","reduction. Reducing emissions in our devices supply chain We continue to work with our device suppliers on carbon reduction interventions, renewable energy alternatives, and manufacturing process improvements. These reductions include 12 suppliers switching to renewable energy, with six converting to 100 percent renewable energy as members of RE100. Learn more about our efforts in our FY22 Responsible Sourcing Report. Decarbonizing transportation We partner with our transportation logistics ecosystem to implement decarbonization solutions across our logistics network. In 2022, our logistics teams explored new ways to mitigate sources of logistics emissions. Based on the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework and","cutting-edge tooling, the new emissions approach will enable strategic investments and optimizations across Microsoft’s logistics operations in support of decarbonized transportation. In FY22, we supported the avoidance of 28,000 mtCO2e in partnership with our suppliers by shifting cargo from carbon intense modes (air and truck) to lower-carbon modes (ocean and rail). We also launched the first alternative energy vehicle (AEV) pilots for trucking. Advancing sustainable aviation Microsoft is advancing efforts to increase the production of and accounting standards for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In 2022, we piloted the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterial’s (RSB) “book and claim” process, which will result","in a SAF certificate for Microsoft in collaboration with United Airlines and AirBP. In July 2022 Microsoft announced a partnership with Alaska Airlines and Twelve, a Climate Innovation Fund investee, to operate the first demonstration flight using e-Jet, a low-carbon jet fuel produced from recaptured carbon dioxide, water, and renewable energy. Microsoft worked together with the Environmental Defense Fund to publish the High Integrity Sustainable Aviation Fuel Handbook. 19 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Transitioning to carbon-free energy Electricity use accounts for the vast majority of Microsoft’s operational carbon emissions","footprint. In parallel to energy reductions and efficiencies, our work supports the growth and adoption of more carbon-free energy. Our long-term vision is to reach a state where, on all the world’s grids, 100 percent of electrons, 100 percent of the time, are generated from zero-carbon sources. On the path to reaching this vision, our commitment is to cover 100 percent of Microsoft’s load with renewable energy purchases by 2025, and by 2030 to ensure that we meet our 100/100/0 commitment, meaning 100 percent of Microsoft’s electricity consumption, 100 percent of the time, will be matched by zero-carbon energy purchases.","In FY22, we continued to work with industry-leading partners such as Shell, Constellation, and ENGIE to procure new carbon-free energy resources to meet our goals. To continue advancing the green energy economy in the United States and in recognition of the opportunity to proactively collaborate on driving a more reliable domestic solar module supply chain, Microsoft is collaborating with Hanwha to increase domestic green energy manufacturing through a first-of-its-kind initiative for major equipment and associated construction services. By partnering with Hanwha, Microsoft seeks to facilitate quicker adoption of domestic green energy equipment supply through its pipeline of domestic power purchase","agreements (PPAs). In FY22, we signed new power purchase agreements around the globe, bringing our total portfolio of PPAs for carbon-free energy to over 13.5 GW. This includes deals across 16 countries including New Zealand, the Netherlands, Chile, Singapore, Austria, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Globally, we have more than 135 renewables projects in our PPA portfolio and are positioned to continue to grow our renewable resource procurement to meet our goals. Committing to environmental justice in carbon-free energy procurement In addition to carbon-free energy, Microsoft has made commitments to diversity and inclusion, and to racial equity. An important point","of intersection for these is environmental justice. To support environmental justice outcomes in a reimagined energy sector, Microsoft is in its third year of modeling approaches that link our carbon-free energy commitments with community-led clean energy and resiliency projects. Through partnerships, we have established new renewable energy procurement models that create new opportunities for frontline communities by equitably distributing the benefits of the clean energy economy. We’ve shared our lessons learned in a position paper with Volt Energy Utility, including an Environmental Justice Measurement & Evaluation Framework that guides our initiatives. Examples of how we’ve worked to integrate equity and","justice into our approaches include the following: We supported the development of two new community solar gardens in Illinois, which are expected to have a capacity of 4.75 MW with a focus on expanding access to renewable power to traditionally under-resourced populations. ENGIE and Microsoft are working with a leading community solar organizer and provider, Solstice, who engage directly with residents and community organizations in cities and counties across the United States to provide access to renewables for customers that cannot afford to install rooftop solar. Solstice pioneered EnergyScore, a unique solution that uses utility payment history and other customer","data to provide a more accurate and inclusive prediction of an individual’s ability to pay an energy bill. Once fully subscribed, the two solar gardens could save Illinois subscribers more than $100,000 a year in total electricity costs, while also reducing carbon emissions equivalent to more than 1,000 households’ average electricity usage. We supported a 6.6-MW solar facility in Panola County, Mississippi, which provides first-time solar access to consumers in a county with majority Black residents and a poverty rate that is double the United States average. By using emissions data to determine where new solar generation can displace the","most carbon, Clearloop is collaborating with Microsoft to expand access to clean energy in a state that currently relies on fossil fuels to power nearly 90 percent of its electricity. Clearloop will also collaborate with local community programs to provide workforce development, training, and hiring opportunities. Through a justice-centered selection process led by the Just Transition PowerForce, we provided environmental justice grants to seven organizations that advance climate readiness, economic opportunity, and health and wellbeing in their communities: Native Renewables, Three Part Harmony Farm, Bridging the Gap in Virginia, West Atlanta Watershed Alliance, Pittsburghers for Public Transit, Harambee House, and","Little Village Environmental Justice Organization. To support environmental justice outcomes in a reimagined energy sector, Microsoft is in its third year of modeling approaches that link our carbon-free energy commitments with community-led clean energy and resiliency projects. 12% We also redesigned rack components, resulting in a reduction of plastic by 12 percent for certain components. 20 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Transitioning to carbon-free energy (continued) Contribution to collective action to decarbonize the electric grid This year, with Sustainable Energy for All (SE For All), an organization that works in","partnership with the United Nations, Microsoft committed to take actions that drive toward decarbonization of the electric grid to combat climate change. Energy Compacts were introduced in 2021 as a key outcome of the High- level Dialogue on Energy, which calls for affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. Microsoft joins national and local governments, businesses, foundations, and international civil society and youth organizations from every region who have submitted Energy Compacts, reflecting actions and finance commitments. Microsoft’s Energy Compact documents its 100/100/0 commitment to carbon- free energy. Other projects With PosiGen Louisiana Solar, we supported the","reduction of electricity bills for low-to-moderate income residents through financing solar and energy efficiency projects that can also strengthen resiliency for homes in underserved communities. We supported programs with California Rooftop Solar at Wildmind Science Center, which funds environmental engagement programs for 120,000 at-risk youth. Microsoft has purchased solar RECs from school districts that were supported by the California Bright Schools program. The program identifies energy saving opportunities for schools, saving general fund dollars and providing educational opportunities for students and teachers. We supported the purchase of “Peace RECs” (P-RECs) in Sub-Saharan Africa. These credits are generated through projects located","in countries with high risk of conflict, high vulnerability to climate change, low levels of electrification, and limited access to renewable energy finance. In May 2022, Microsoft made the largest P-REC transaction to date, building on our first P-REC purchase in 2020. This first purchase funded the installation of public streetlights connected to Nuru’s 1.3-MW solar mini-grid in Ndosho neighborhood in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our 2022 purchase also supports first-time electricity connections for households, businesses, and social institutions, and deploys additional streetlights that improve nighttime security and allow local businesses and markets to operate during evening hours.","The purchase also contributes directly to the financing of Nuru’s new 3.7 MW solar metro-grid, which is anticipated to serve 5,000 customers and enhance more than 25,000 lives. Together, these projects are some of the largest off-grid mini- grids operating in Sub-Saharan Africa, eventually benefiting 125,000 people and raising the average electricity rate from three percent to around 20 percent.

Over the past 18 months, we have developed the process and structures to create long-term carbon removal offtake agreements designed to get new projects built. This","is how we can move past many of the quality challenges prevalent in the market today and take CDR to scale. Our offtake agreements are built on our experience procuring renewable energy, tailorable to the risks faced by diverse removal approaches, and structured to enable projects to gain outside financing. We are now building a portfolio with the goal of greater than five million metric tons a year in offtakes in order to hit our 2030 goals, balanced across low, medium, and high- durability solutions. We are moving into the next phase of our carbon removal journey. Offtake agreements Our","first offtake agreement with Climeworks was announced in July 2022 and we’ve followed up with several additional large investments of increasing scales. We are targeting multiple multi-year purchases of up to 250,000 tons per year to serve as a risk-diversified portfolio of projects meeting our needs in 2030 and beyond. 2022 projects and results In FY22, we contracted 1,443,981 metric tons of carbon removal. We also made multi-year commitments to carbon removal. These projects will provide around 300,000 metric tons towards our greater than five million metric ton goal in 2030.

Second, bringing in more demand for CDR after the landmark announcements of the First Movers Coalition and Frontier Climate. Third, trialing the emerging set of second wave, hybrid carbon removal solutions that are coming to market, such as Heirloom, which combines advantages of carbon mineralization and direct air capture (DAC) to amplify the natural ability of limestone to remove carbon dioxide from the air. Fourth, identifying the best","ways to embed carbon removal solutions in an overall circular economy. 2023 carbon removal key projects Climeworks offtake In July 2022, we signed a 10-year forward agreement with Climeworks to purchase DAC removals from their Orca and Mammoth plants, building on our earlier purchase commitment with Climeworks. This prototypical agreement is our model for taking carbon removal to scale and meeting our ambitious goals. Climate Robotics Early in 2022, we signed a small deal with Climate Robotics and we doubled- down in August with a four-year, 75,000 metric ton contract. We believe this is among the largest direct biochar CDR","procurements to date. Climate Robotics’ novel approach to biochar production will eliminate the transport of biomass to central plants, instead taking pyrolizers to the fields where crop waste is processed and re-tilled. O.C.O Technology In September 2022, we signed a deal for 25,000 metric tons of CDR from O.C.O’s mineralization technology, which takes industrial waste (like fly ash) and uses it as the core of manufactured limestone. That’s a neat bit of upcycling and a great way to work carbon removal into a circular-economy solution. Moreover, O.C.O showed pragmatic, long-term thinking by holding back some tonnage until empirical results clarify","marginal carbon accounting uncertainty. CommuniTree We renewed our investment in the CommuniTree project in November 2022, signing for 700,000 metric tons in the form of ex ante credits over the next two years, which we project will deliver >100,000 metric tons of ex post verified carbon in 2030 and subsequent years.

GHG accounting standards provide limited guidance on how to address Scope 3 emissions. For too long, the lack of a clear starting point has led to persistent inaction on Scope 3. The private sector needs a new approach; one that prioritizes learning by doing and innovation through experience. We are enacting a five-part Scope 3 strategy: 1 Increasing efficiency: We will design our products and infrastructure in ways that reduce energy and carbon intensity, minimizing both downstream and upstream carbon emissions. 2 Building markets: Scaling sustainability initiatives, such as","the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund and carbon fee, position us to invest in and purchase from nascent technology providers, like Heirloom, to build supply chains for decarbonized materials and fuels. 3 Forging partnerships: Microsoft cannot achieve carbon negative alone. We will scale supply chain decarbonization by aligning financial and government leadership, to signal global market demand and infuse investment into infrastructure and technology solutions worldwide. 4 Improving measurement: We cannot manage what we cannot measure. We are developing improved Scope 3 data visibility and carbon accounting methodologies to better guide and reflect meaningful actions towards reducing carbon emissions. 5 Advocating","for policy: We will propose and endorse public policies that enrich markets, partnerships, and measurement activities, with a focus on “greening the grid,” by further opening the power sector to corporate clean energy purchases and upgrading electric transmission.

We measure and report the global water use of our campuses and datacenters to drive efficiency and reuse. 5 Pillars of water positive 1 Reducing our water footprint across our direct operations 2 Increasing access to water and sanitation services 3 Replenishing more water than we consume across our operations 4 Scaling water solutions through innovation and digitization 5 Advocating for effective and innovative water policy Designing for efficiency","Microsoft employs a comprehensive lifecycle assessment methodology in our datacenters that goes beyond typical carbon-centric measurements and considers the GHG emissions, energy, water, and other environmental impacts of technology, from servers to full datacenters. Our approach accounts for the entire cycle of production, transport, use, and end of life in order to calculate the environmental burdens of these systems and identify opportunities for reductions. It is empowering our own teams to consider the full environmental impact of their designs—both today and in the future. In 2022 we formally shared our standard operating procedure (SOP) recommendations so that others in the","datacenter industry can improve their own lifecycle assessment. As our datacenter business continues to grow, Microsoft is committed to reducing the intensity with which we withdraw from our resources, both water and energy. We design for efficiency to reduce the water intensity of our operations. Increasing efficiency in existing systems Water usage effectiveness (WUE) is a key metric relating to the efficient and sustainable operations of our datacenters and is a crucial aspect as we work towards our commitment to be water positive by 2030. WUE is calculated by dividing the liters of water used for humidification and cooling of","the datacenter by the total annual amount of power (measured in kWh) needed to operate our datacenter IT equipment. There are variables that can affect WUE, many of which relate to the location of the datacenter. Datacenters in some parts of the world, like Sweden and Finland, operate in naturally cooler environments and require no freshwater for cooling, whereas warmer climates like Phoenix will require water for portions of the year. Our datacenter designs minimize water use through all climates. As our datacenter business continues to grow, Microsoft is committed to reducing the intensity with which we withdraw from our","resources, both water and energy, focusing on being as efficient as possible while balancing the needs for power and water in the regions where we develop. All future built datacenters will be LEED Gold certified with an emphasis on water and energy conservation. 30 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Reducing our water footprint (continued) Recycling and repurposing Wherever possible, we look at recycling and repurposing water at our datacenters and campuses, including harvesting rainwater, procuring reclaimed water, and reusing water within our facilities. Recycling and reusing water We measure and","monitor reused water at datacenters and campuses across the globe and use meters to collect real-time data on usage, including recycling, for owned datacenters. We design our cooling systems to reduce consumption to address stressed areas, geographic locations, and poor water quality. For recycling, in our Arizona and Mexico datacenters we are treating the incoming water to maximize cycles and minimizing water discharge to drain. Our Johannesburg office greywater treatment plant is separately metered to track water reused monthly. At our Silicon Valley campus, which is pursuing net-zero water certification and is on track to be one of first tech","campuses to secure this certification, we operate a water treatment plant to process on-site grey and black water for reuse and have established a water budget to quantify the amount of water captured, recycled, and reused on-site. We incorporate rainwater harvesting and reuse at our campuses and datacenters around the globe. Procuring reclaimed water from utilities While availability of reclaimed water is limited, we procure reclaimed water from utilities where it is available to reduce our dependence on freshwater supply. We are procuring reclaimed water at our datacenters in Washington, Texas, California, and Singapore. We also continue to move forward","on plans to access municipal recycled water for landscaping and plumbing at LinkedIn’s Mountain View headquarters. We are currently testing municipal recycled water quality to confirm on-site treatment requirements. This project is anticipated to save approximately 30,500 m3 of potable water annually when implemented, which we expect to be completed in 2023. Harvesting rainwater We incorporate rainwater harvesting and reuse at our campuses and datacenters around the globe. We are harvesting rainwater in our Netherlands, Ireland, and Sweden datacenters and have rainwater harvesting in the designs for new datacenters in England, Finland, Italy, South Africa, and Austria. At our Silicon","Valley and Beijing campuses, harvested rainwater is used for toilet flushing, landscaping irrigation, road washing, and more. We also have plans for rainwater harvesting at our Redmond, England, Ireland, and Namibia campuses. Improving the quality of stormwater runoff Our Redmond Campus Modernization project is focused on improving the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff. We implemented an underground parking garage, removing approximately 13.9 acres of previous surface parking and roadways, and avoided copper and zinc coated metal panels in our campus to eliminate any toxicity to downstream aquatic life. The campus is also Salmon-Safe Certified, reducing the impacts it has","on water quality and fish habitat. 13.9 We removed 13.9 acres of surface parking and roadways at our Redmond Campus.

Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Reducing our water footprint (continued) Innovating new water technologies Innovation is a critical component of our water reduction approach at campuses and datacenters. We are investing in water reduction technologies including thermal energy, cooling technologies, and air-to-water generation.","Saving water through thermal energy Our Thermal Energy Center in Redmond is predicted to save over 37,850 m3 of water per year through several unconventional approaches to heat rejection. The geoexchange field transfers heat into the ground, which is approximately 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The system’s wells and tanks will store water as heat energy for future use, instead of expelling it through the cooling towers, which is expected to reduce water use by 30,280 m3 a year or roughly the volume of 12 Olympic pools. As Microsoft and the industry continues to advance immersion cooling technology, we’re also looking at","ways to optimize the performance of chips beyond their pre-defined voltage, thermal, and power design limits, a concept called overclocking. Keeping datacenters cool with less water We continue to integrate our standards in water reduction technologies where we use direct outside air most of the year to cool servers. We otherwise cool through direct evaporation that requires a fraction of the water compared to other, conventional water- based cooling systems such as water-cooled chillers. By powering our datacenter with power from the Sun Streams 2 Solar Project owned by local partner, Longroad Energy, we are displacing the water needed in","the traditional electricity generation process. Pioneering liquid immersion cooling In 2021, Microsoft was the first cloud provider to run two-phased liquid immersion cooling in a production environment. At the component level, we’re testing new biodegradable materials to empower greater circularity of our servers and exploring microfluidics to cool chips more efficiently. As Microsoft and the industry continues to advance immersion cooling technology, we’re also looking at ways to optimize the performance of chips beyond their pre-defined voltage, thermal, and power design limits, a concept called overclocking. Investing in air-to-water generation As climate change exacerbates water risks, air-to- water generation is","an important innovation that we are investing in, both within our own four walls and through our recent investment in SOURCE, a renewable water technology that is powered by solar. We are also investing in air-to-water generation across our operations. Four new air-to-water generators were installed at our Hyderabad campus in 2020 and 2021, each has an installed capacity of 500 liters. We installed an adiabatic cooling system at our Bengaluru campus, which has reduced our energy consumption, in line with our efforts to make our HVAC systems more efficient. 37,850 m3 The Redmond Campus Thermal Energy Center is predicted","to save over 37,850 m3 of water per year.

Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Replenishing water Microsoft is committed to replenishing more water than we consume across our operations. We focus on investing in replenishment projects that protect watersheds, restore wetlands, and improve infrastructure in water- stressed regions where we operate. We use the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting","(VWBA) guidance to quantify the estimated volumetric water benefits that can be claimed from a range of different replenishment project types. We seek to align the project type with the unique needs of each location; for example, in a location with high water quality challenges, we will focus on projects that help to improve water quality in the basin. We have contracted for 27 replenishment projects, totaling more than 35 million m3 of potential volumetric water benefit and have invested $7 million in the program overall. In FY22, we invested in six new projects, which are expected to replenish more","than 15 million m3 of water in the next decade. To date, we have contracted for 27 replenishment projects, totaling more than 35 million m3 of potential volumetric water benefit and have invested $7 million in the program overall. We are building the infrastructure to ensure that we can scale to 40 priority water-stressed locations across the globe and are looking at a blend of traditional and more innovative replenishment projects. We are also partnering with companies and other key stakeholders to further define how organizations should account for benefits and the types of projects that should be prioritized in","key locations. In FY22, we invested in a range of different types of projects from agricultural water efficiency to groundwater restoration to watershed restoration, including the following: Supporting water infiltration and groundwater recharge in San Antonio In 2021, we partnered with the Edwards Aquifer Authority to acquire a conservation easement and keep lands from being developed in San Antonio, Texas. The easement focuses on lands that are most likely threatened by rapid development or negative- management practices and ensure these lands are not developed to allow for water infiltration and groundwater recharge. Targeted acquisition of conservation easements and implementation of","land management practices are projected to protect, on average, 0.6 acre-feet of recharge-per protected acre—with the potential to increase average recharge rates over time through the establishment of land- management practices. Restoring Sembakkam Lake and wetlands in Chennai, India We supported The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in improving water quality, storage capacity and groundwater recharge of Lake Sembakkam. The project is establishing a nature-based wastewater treatment system at the lake using a constructed wetland system that is estimated to treat 6,000-7,000 m3 of wastewater entering the lake per day and benefit approximately 10,000 people. These solutions will improve groundwater recharge, biodiversity","habitat, and flood control. They will also create a waterfront to serve as a recreational site for community members. Improving precision agriculture in Santiago, Chile In 2022, we contracted a project to improve agricultural water efficiency and overall water supply reliability in the Maipo Basin in Chile, the key watershed that Santiago depends upon. The project is expected to begin realizing benefits in 2023. Microsoft is partnering with Kilimo and using its IT platform to catalyze change by educating and supporting farmers in optimizing water use. The project aims to increase agricultural efficiency and productivity, reduce water demand, and protect","ground and surface water resources. The project will support expanded applications of Internet of Things (IoT)-based satellite moisture and irrigation management systems on 360 hectares of private irrigated family farms to decrease water pumping and diversion. We tailor replenishment projects to meet the needs of the communities we impact. 33 | | | Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix Improving access to water We continue to make progress towards our commitment to provide 1.5 million people with access to safe drinking water and sanitation solutions by 2030. One in four people across the globe","do not have access to clean water and this is expected to increase as water challenges are exacerbated by climate change. In 2020, we committed to providing Water.org with $3 million over three years to provide micro-loans to cover a range of solutions, such as installation of household taps and toilets, rainwater harvesting, storage and well restoration for communities and schools. We are helping to develop resources that support organizations in understanding the different types of accessibility projects they can invest in across different types of water, sanitation, and health (WASH) solutions. In FY22, Microsoft’s contribution has provided more than","550,000 people with access to clean water and sanitation services in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico. This project reached just under one million people by December 2022. We are also helping to develop resources to support organizations in understanding the different types of accessibility projects they can invest in, as well how to quantify the benefits and impacts from these investments across different types of water, sanitation, and health (WASH) solutions. Increasing water access in Mexico Mexico is facing extreme water challenges as a result of increasing demands on water resources. In peri-urban towns outside of Mexico City, the local","government subsidizes water for their residents. This is a common approach to help improve household access to water; however, it is not holistic. Patty, a healthcare worker, was unable to get the amount of water her family needed through the program. She used to wait hours each month to receive her household ration of water, taking time away from work and earning income. To supplement the water she did receive, Patty bought bottled water and saved rainwater in a makeshift bucket to use for cooking, laundry, and bathing. Contigo, a local partner of Water.org, allowed Patty to affordably finance a","rain storage solution with a large tank, gutters, and a cistern to cover her household water needs. This represents one of the roughly 150,000 micro-loans that Microsoft’s funding has supported across the globe. 550,000 In FY22, Microsoft’s contribution to water. org has provided more than 550,000 people with access to clean water.

Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global","sustainability Appendix Key trends 1 Water requires a collective approach Working collectively to solve challenges at the basin scale is critical. Water is a resource that every person and business on this planet needs to survive. We can use as little water in a location as possible and replenish more than we use, yet that basin can still be highly stressed and not provide local communities with what they need. 2 Replenishment needs to evolve and scale if companies are going to meet their goals Replenishment is a nascent market with limited guidance on what it means, how to account","for benefits, how to make credible claims, and how to ensure replenishment investments are having a significant impact in high-stressed basins. Furthermore, the supply of replenishment projects in many global markets is limited or non-existent. Cultivation of credible partners to manage and implement replenishment projects, as well as investment in innovative replenishment projects with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector entities, are critical to scale the market and collective impact. 3 Innovation is a critical piece of the puzzle Water challenges will become more extreme in the years to come. If we continue with the status quo, we will not","protect freshwater resources for future generations. Organizations need to innovate within their own operations, supply chain, and the communities in which they operate by investing in solutions that maximize efficiency and reduce dependence on freshwater resources. There is also an important role for organizations and investors to play in providing the capital to scale water technologies needed to tackle water scarcity, quality, and access.

We will look at projects with innovative funding mechanisms, such as revolving or low-interest loans. We also plan to look at projects where we procure volumetric water benefit from private sector entities, including start-ups, that offer a unique solution to the water challenges we face today, for example leak detection projects in distribution networks and transmission mains. As we","invest in these projects and track learnings, we remain committed to sharing those with others. 2 Integrating environmental justice into replenishment Environmental justice is embedded in our water access target, and we are looking for ways to be more intentional about integrating environmental justice into our replenishment investments as well. This includes looking at ways we can ensure our replenishment investments support disadvantaged communities, as well as the potential unintended consequences of projects that could cause harm to disadvantaged communities in the locations where we operate. 3 Scaling our efforts to reduce water use across operations Investment in reduction is","a critical component of our water positive commitment and one we are focusing on as we get closer to 2030. While we continue to maximize our efficiency for our datacenters and campuses, we will also continue to look for opportunities to invest in innovations that will help us to further reduce our dependence on freshwater sources. 4 Investing in projects that will increase access to water and sanitation solutions We are looking for ways to scale our investments in new and existing locations where people lack access to water and sanitation services. Micro-loans are a unique solution and fill a","need in many locations across the globe. There are also many people across the globe who can’t afford a loan and thus are not supported through the types of investments we have made thus far. As we move towards 2030 and beyond, we will be looking for ways to support populations that are not being reached.

Linear take-make-waste systems and existing infrastructure are not adequate to maintain, collect, and redistribute materials effectively for a global circular economy. We recognize the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions associated with the lifecycle of these materials. As a company that manufactures devices, builds campuses and datacenters, and uses manufactured goods in our operations, we have committed to responsibly design and source","materials and build a more circular approach into our work and the world. To reach our commitment to become a zero waste company by 2030, Microsoft is taking an increasingly circular approach to materials management to reduce waste and carbon emissions. Our strategy goes beyond waste diversion as we work across our value chain, beginning with design and material selection. Wherever possible, we reduce the amount of materials needed. We responsibly source materials for our operations, products, and packaging. We are increasing the use of recycled and recyclable content, reducing hazardous substances, and designing out waste. We aim to keep","products and materials in use longer through reuse and repair. We reduce waste generation at end of life with recycling and composting programs.

Reducing waste in our cloud hardware A critical piece of achieving our zero waste goal is managing cloud hardware at our growing fleet of datacenters. We have taken an innovative approach towards designing and implementing circularity into our datacenters by launching Circular Centers to optimize reuse. Reusing and recycling cloud hardware","In FY21, we piloted our new approach to asset reuse by building a Circular Center within our Amsterdam datacenter campus, which represented seven percent of our server capacity globally. We process decommissioned cloud hardware to service strategic routes, secondary markets, and suppliers using intelligent routing software. Our Amsterdam Circular Center model achieved reuse and recycle of 82 percent of all decommissioned assets in FY22. Our Circular Centers also achieved a four percent reduction in carbon per server. Based on the success of the Amsterdam location, we opened four new Circular Centers in FY22 in Boydton, Virginia; Chicago, Illinois; Dublin, Ireland;","and Singapore. We are launching our next Circular Centers in Quincy, Washington in FY23 and in Texas in FY25. This model enables suppliers to reuse assets and components, resulting in significant carbon emissions reduction and material recovery. We are designing and implementing circularity into our datacenters by launching Circular Centers that optimize reuse. Developing technology to drive a circular cloud Our Circular Center approach starts with sustainable design and responsible sourcing of an asset. Microsoft designs a growing portion of its own hardware portfolio, and we make sustainability considerations a key part of the entire Microsoft Azure hardware design process—including","energy efficiency, repairability, upgradability, and durability. To enact these principles at scale, we developed a patent-pending Intelligent Disposition and Routing System (IDARS) that establishes and executes a zero waste plan for our cloud hardware assets. IDARS is an end-to-end system that identifies the most sustainable disposition path for every part at any point in its lifecycle across the supply chain. Paired with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Microsoft Power Platform, IDARS utilizes the bill of materials of assets, inventory, and demand to optimize the sustainable path, and provides Circular Center technicians with precise instructions on how to steward","the asset onto its next phase. This technology, along with our close collaboration with both upstream and downstream partners, offers a model for the technology industry. Defining design requirements for cloud hardware In 2022, Microsoft published ecodesign requirements for cloud hardware. This specification outlines the sustainability guidelines, including energy and material efficiency requirements, that suppliers must follow when designing hardware for the Microsoft Cloud, such as the use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and use of recycled content requirements in some packaging. In the same timeframe, we began collecting material content and sustainability data for transport packaging materials. Using our","current hardware data collection process, we can now digest data such as weights, material type, and recycled content that can be used for regulatory purposes and to enable our suppliers to deliver energy and material efficient hardware contributing to carbon and waste reduction. Eliminating waste starts with sustainable design and responsible sourcing at our campuses and datacenters.

Designing for lower-carbon and circular devices use Our accessory devices have shorter development cycles, making them a great vehicle to test new circular materials. We test new materials in individual products and, if successful, expand their use across a broader product portfolio. Circular design must also account for a future in which products can easily be returned, repaired, refurbished, and resold. Microsoft devices are also built to last, which helps increase circularity by keeping materials in use longer. The Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher Program gives new life to used","and returned devices—repurposing over three million devices in FY22. Innovating with suppliers on materials We are partnering with suppliers on more sustainable material innovations. In our hardware supply chain, we are working on using 100 percent recycled tin solder paste and 100 percent recycled gold in our printed circuit boards. We are phasing out single-use plastics in battery packs by reusing packs multiple times. We are also reducing waste in our software supply chain by eliminating physical cards and enabling digital downloads for games, apps, and gift cards. Designing for and enabling repair Repairability can offer significant carbon emissions and","waste reduction benefits. Microsoft continues to invest in this important space and the findings will aid in our product design and plans for expanding device repair options for our customers that are safe, effective, and sustainable. Our latest Surface products feature a host of replaceable components. Repairability goes beyond design.

We're thinking through everything from durable serviceware to air filters with circularity in mind. Transforming to zero waste campuses Our Puget Sound campus","has been Zero Waste certified since 2016. LinkedIn has been collecting annual waste data from most of its high impact sites and plans to continue expanding the collection to other sites in the next two to three years. The goals are to reduce pre- and post-consumer food waste, avoid waste collection contamination, reduce packaging in kitchen deliveries, transition all parts of the program to 100 percent reusable dishware, and eliminate single-use packaging in micro kitchens. Zero waste San Antonio, Quincy, Boydton, and Dublin datacenter locations all renewed their zero waste certifications in FY22. Achieving zero waste datacenters Microsoft has a","goal to achieve 90 percent reuse or recycle of our cloud computing hardware assets by 2025. In FY22, we renewed Zero Waste certifications for our San Antonio, Quincy, Boydton, and Dublin, datacenter locations. In FY22, we invested in enhancing the program's business intelligence using a suite of waste data tools, including Microsoft Power Apps and Power BI, to track the waste performance of our datacenters. Going beyond our operations As we pursue our zero waste and circularity goals, we also look for opportunities to provide community co-benefits where we operate. Atlanta's Zero Waste Westside initiative, sponsored with Microsoft grant funding,","shows the power of justice- centered community-led sustainability enterprises. The collaboration brings food waste collection and recovery, composting services, and education to the Westside Atlanta community. The concept was also informed by the Environmental Justice Measurement and Evaluation Framework, co-created by Microsoft and the Just Transition PowerForce. The enterprise is run by three local organizations led by Black women with long- standing commitments to social and environmental justice. With Microsoft's support, the collective secured farm equipment to improve composting processes and more than double output at their community compost lab. It is poised to scale service offerings to businesses. As","we pursue our zero waste and circularity goals, we also look for opportunities to provide community co-benefits where we operate. Reducing construction and deconstruction waste Microsoft is approaching the design, construction, and deconstruction of the buildings in our datacenter and campus portfolio with circularity in mind and identifying ways to prevent waste from the offset. Innovating the construction process We are innovating our construction processes to reduce waste throughout our entire lifecycle and supply chain. In FY22, we developed a playbook that standardized our internal processes for diverting construction waste. We implemented a construction and deconstruction waste app to collect","data from our general contractors globally to increase transparency and traceability. We also implemented a new database that stores, displays, and analyzes real-time global waste diversion data. Moving forward, priority strategies including construction circularity, upstream design considerations, a steel scrap take-back program, repurposing of excess concrete, and mitigation of hard-to-recycle materials, are all becoming standard elements of our datacenter construction projects. Improving our diversion rates We have a goal of 75 percent construction and deconstruction waste diversion for all projects, including tenant improvement, and 90 percent diversion for core and shell projects over 75,000 square feet.

Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix 59 | | | Sustainable devices Reducing environmental impact in our devices Over the past year, Microsoft has continued our work to reduce environmental impacts of our devices by increasing circularity and reducing carbon intensity across the entire product lifecycle. For example, we have revamped our Surface product development process to define sustainability targets on our product roadmaps for every major future launch. Hardware is only one","piece of the story. Microsoft is in a unique position to promote sustainability improvements across the full devices stack: hardware, software, and games. Last year, we released Shutdown (energy saving) mode for Xbox, which became the default power experience in November 2021 and has been adopted by 39 percent of our consoles. In September 2022, Windows Update became carbon aware, making it easier for our devices to reduce carbon emissions. When devices are plugged in, turned on, and connected to the internet, and regional carbon intensity data is available, Windows Update will schedule installations at specific times of the day","when doing so may result in lower carbon emissions because a higher proportion of electricity is coming from lower-carbon sources on the electric grid. Designing for sustainability Improving the sustainability of our devices starts with hardware design. Informed by lifecycle assessments (LCAs), we set explicit carbon and repairability targets during product design to ensure year-over-year improvement. Designing with circularity in mind— keeping materials and products in use longer—is key to achieving these goals. And we strive to meet rigorous third-party ecolabels and ecostandards—all of our newest laptops and tablets are registered EPEAT® Gold and are ENERGY STAR® Certified. We continue","to work to reduce environmental impacts of our devices by increasing circularity and reducing carbon intensity across the entire product lifecycle. Building a data-driven carbon platform Each device we sell is a complex amalgamation of new and recycled materials, manufacturing and assembly processes, distribution, lifetime product usage, and eventual disposition. We quantify the lifecycle environmental impacts of each product and publish summarized results from our LCAs in our product EcoProfiles. We are building an advanced carbon data platform that combines advancements in LCA, product usage telemetry, and real-time distribution data to get the most representative emissions profile possible for our","devices. This data will be used for reporting and to provide visibility into actionable and granular environmental impacts to continue improving decision- making at all levels. This year alone, we more than doubled the percentage of the total carbon footprint calculated based on suppliers' primary LCA data. Testing lower-carbon, circular design Our accessory devices have shorter development cycles, making them an ideal way to test new circular materials. We trial new materials in individual products, and if successful, we expand their use across our broader portfolio—such as in Windows Dev Kit 2023, an ARM- based developer kit featuring 20 percent","recycled ocean plastic11, a material first proven in our Ocean Plastic Mouse. Circular design must also account for a future in which products can easily be returned, repaired, refurbished, and resold. Incorporating recycled materials in devices Without compromising on our design and quality, we routinely evaluate opportunities for the use of recycled material content. For example, many of our PC accessories contain recycled plastic, including our new Adaptive Accessories and Audio Dock, which are both made with at least 30 percent post-consumer recycled plastic resin. Designing with circularity in mind helps to keep products in use longer and improves the","sustainability of our devices.

Microsoft continues to invest in this important space and the findings will aid in our product design and plans for expanding device repair options for our customers that are safe, effective, and sustainable. Our latest computer products, including Surface Pro 9, Surface Laptop 5, Surface Laptop Go 2, and Surface Studio 2+, all feature a host of replaceable components. Repairability goes beyond design.","This year we piloted the sale of certain spare parts on Microsoft.com and began expanding our network of local Authorized Service Providers (ASPs) which are qualified to repair Microsoft devices. We are also improving our capability to deliver broader availability of spare parts for independent repairers and consumers, targeting the first half of 2023. We continue to make our Service Guides available at Microsoft.com and repair videos available online. Through the ASP network, we are able not only to reduce waste but also to save on GHG emissions by shortening the distance that a device travels to a repair center.","Microsoft has also spent the past several years investing in regional repair hubs in major geographies that are equipped to make same-unit repairs. We are onboarding authorized repair partners across Surface markets to expand our authorized repair network and bring repair options closer to our customers. Enabling these localized repair hubs has led to quantifiable reductions in reverse logistics emissions (over 10 percent in some cases). Manufacturing Microsoft devices suppliers' GHG emissions reduction amounted to approximately 90,000 mtCO2e in FY22, roughly equivalent to 17,000 homes' average annual energy usage. This was achieved through supplier carbon reduction interventions, renewable energy alternatives,","and manufacturing process improvements. These reductions resulted from 12 suppliers switching to renewable energy, with six converting to 100 percent renewable energy. You can find more detail and individual supplier case studies in the Microsoft Responsible Sourcing Report. Empowering and financing decarbonization Microsoft realizes that financing is a common barrier to decarbonization and has partnered with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, to stand up a program for the IFC to offer financing solutions to eligible suppliers to support decarbonization efforts. IFC also offers eligible Microsoft suppliers its advisory services to identify","technical solutions for reducing GHG emissions in the manufacturing process.

Purchasing responsibly Microsoft is committed to helping customers understand how to purchase devices that pose fewer environmental impacts. For example, we engaged with PC makers across the industry to drive sustainability best practices and provided guidance to channel partners and our sales team on how to select more sustainable PCs through our “Featured Devices” program. We provide in-depth detail on Microsoft device sustainability and repairability through our EcoProfiles and Repair Guides. We provide clarity to consumers on how to reduce","their shipping emissions through ground shipping. And for commercial customers, we provide full-fleet visibility into the carbon impact of a purchase at point of sale through the Surface Emissions Estimator. Reducing distribution footprint In FY22, our devices supply chain organization engaged in key optimization projects, resulting in over 6,300 mtCO2e avoidance from the global network. Key network adjustments enabled a shift to sea freight, resulting in 3,200 mtCO2e savings. We optimized our inbound containerized freight processes to allow for increased container utilization. Outbound freight consolidations for one US retailer yielded 900 mtCO2e and collaborated cross-functionally to reduce over 800 mtCO2e","within our customer network through order optimization and consolidation. With investments in on-site solar generation, our key European and American distribution centers, which handle over half of all Microsoft devices sold, now produce over two million kWh of solar energy and are 100 percent powered by renewable energy. In Europe, our parcel deliveries are via electric or carbon neutral vehicles, where the capability is available. Less-than- truckload networks deliver via electric vehicles on the final mile transport with identified customers. Our global logistics network is optimized to reduce carbon intensity. And we inform our customers about how they can achieve","more sustainable purchase and use decisions when buying or using Microsoft products. Increasing packaging sustainability We are using innovation and design rigor to make progress on our journey to eliminate single-use plastic packaging by 2025. We introduced several 100 percent plastic-free packages in FY22, including the Surface Adaptive Kit and Microsoft Ocean Plastic mouse. This packaging is made from 100 percent renewable materials and fully recyclable. Our most recent wave of Surface Laptop 5 and Pro 9 retail packages use less than one percent plastic (by weight) and are over 99 percent recyclable. All virgin paper or fiber used for","these packages is certified as FSC responsibly sourced. We're also focused on eliminating single-use plastics beyond our 2025 commitment for product packaging. For example, we are implementing reuse for plastic shipping trays in our battery pack supply chain and will proliferate such improvements to other systems. Additionally, we're researching the potential use of lower-carbon footprint plastic alternatives for these trays. 100% Our key European and American distribution centers now produce over two million kWh of solar energy and are 100 percent powered by renewable energy.

Microsoft starts by designing and engineering our devices to be more energy efficient and then uses software to further reduce emissions that may result from device usage. Gaining insights from usage data This year, we released a limited run of enhanced Xbox Series X|S consoles with power supply energy monitoring, which provides anonymized insights into console power consumption. This telemetry helps us gather","additional insights across a wide range of user setups and usages in the field, such as power consumption from SSD, USB devices, networking, and power regulation efficiency losses. We are partnering with Carbon Trust and other global tech companies to develop a common methodology for tracking the usage emissions associated with connected devices. Boosting efficiency through software In addition to hardware, software (both our operating systems and the applications and games that run on top of them) and a shift towards more cloud computing have a major role to play in reducing use-phase emissions. See our section on green software.","Telemetry helps us gather additional insights across a wide range of user setups and usages in the field. Improving efficiency through hardware The Surface Pro 9 and Surface Laptop 5 are among Microsoft's most energy efficient Surface computers. Both devices are ENERGY STAR® Certified, consuming less than half the recommended energy limit set by the latest ENERGY STAR® computer specification. In particular, Surface Pro 9 5G, powered by ARM technology, combines the energy efficiency of modern mobile devices with the computing power of a traditional computer. Repurposing and recycling at end of life Wherever possible, we look to reuse our","hardware with new customers. We start with Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher and Trade-In programs. Where refurbishing and trade-in are not possible, we recycle as much of each device as possible as part of our commitment to achieve 100 percent recyclable devices by 2030. Designing for recyclability As we make progress towards our goal of 100 percent recyclability of Surface devices and Xbox consoles and accessories, we have engaged with the electronics recycling industry to learn about and improve how our products are recycled at end of life. Through research, we noticed a gap between the processes used at electronics recycling centers","and the tools available for us to calculate the recyclability of our products. To address this, we are in the process of switching to a new methodology, consistent with the EN 45555 standard, to increase the accuracy of reporting the recyclability of our packaging and products. This change helps to ensure that future assessments will be representative of the electronics recycling industry, backed by quality data, and repeatable through a step- by-step process, and will address both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of device recyclability. For transparency, we will recalculate the recyclability of products mentioned in previous sustainability reports. We","design our devices to be more energy efficient, helping to reduce the impact of product usage. +++- +++- +++- +++- +++- +++- +++- ' + Partnering to remove consumer recycling barriers In February 2022, Microsoft partnered with three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)— Amazon, Dell, and Google—to launch a consumer electronics collection and recycling pilot in Denver, Colorado. The goal of this pilot, incubated through our participation in Corporate Eco-Forum (CEF), was to identify barriers that consumers face during the disposal of their end-of-life electronics—including nostalgia, lack of convenience, uncertainty around data security, and cost. Based on the pilot, the OEMs","plan to take a data-driven approach to formulate strategies to overcome these barriers. Microsoft also participates in the Circular Electronics Partnership (CEP) to help drive industrywide improvements in circularity. Closing the loop with customers Microsoft offers multiple programs that repurpose or recycle used devices.

In collaboration with global experts in science and policy, we identify critical sustainability problems and mobilize the worldwide scientific community to address them. We develop advanced computational techniques and tools to accelerate breakthroughs on fundamental scientific bottlenecks that","exist within complex, long- term technological and industry transformations required to address climate change. We use approaches from our global AI4Science team, launched in June 2022, to advance the state-of-the-art in scientific discovery by using simulations of natural phenomena to produce training data for large-scale AI models. These advances have greatly sped up the discovery of solutions to critical scientific problems, such as predicting where undersea hydrates will form—a critical factor in safe long-term carbon storage—1,000 times faster than before. These and other computational approaches feed into our programs on sustainability research with industry and academic partners, including Research for","Industry and the Microsoft Climate Research Initiative. Enabling industry breakthroughs Microsoft ensures that all our work is grounded in science, and we extend this approach to our work with customers and partners. As sustainability has become a pressing concern across all industries, our Research for Industry (RFI) program uses our advanced data platforms and technologies for cloud and edge processing, Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, robotics, and AI to contribute to new solutions in multiple industries, including agri-food, energy, retail, and financial services. Enabling more sustainable decision making in agriculture Data-driven and precision agriculture solutions enable more sustainable decision making","for farmers. To inspire the research and data science community in this domain, we made FarmVibes.AI available as an open source toolkit. FarmVibes.AI brings the power of AI to heterogeneous data combined from multiple sources, including satellites and ground sensors. This approach enables lower-cost and higher-accuracy predictions of soil carbon dynamics by automatically generating inputs to common prediction models, such as COMET and DNDC, instead of relying on sometimes faulty and costly-to-obtain historical records. The result is a “what if” analysis tool that can help to estimate how different farming practices will affect the amount of carbon sequestered in the","soil, potentially creating new opportunities for farmers to participate in carbon markets. Predicting microclimates Regions of the world have multiple microclimates, and accurately predicting the behaviors of these microclimates leads to better sustainability outcomes. We are now able to fuse historical weather forecasts with local sensor data to more accurately predict weather parameters in a specific microclimate. We originally developed this technology to help farmers make better operational decisions, such as when to plant or spray, especially in the face of changing weather patterns. This technology is included in FarmVibes.AI, but is broadly applicable to other industries that must adapt","to climate change. For example, logistics and supply chains can be affected by hyperlocal weather events, causing ripple effects throughout many industries, such as retail, manufacturing, and transport. Renewable energy production forecasts are also highly dependent on local weather, affecting renewable energy operators as well as managers of electricity grids. Modeling carbon flow Carbon capture and storage (CCS) involves extracting carbon dioxide from sources like industrial emissions, then liquefying and storing it underground or undersea. CCS relies on equation-based models that predict the suitability of a storage site, such as its storage capacity and risk of leakage. Using traditional numerical","simulation to maximize storage capacity and minimize leakage is time-consuming and costly. Reducing the cost of these simulations can help realize the full potential of CCS. Using Fourier Neural Operators with a 4D deep learning (AI) model, we built a carbon flow surrogate model that produces good approximations from 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than traditional simulators, enabling solutions to problems that would otherwise be prohibitively costly to solve, such as storage capacity maximization. We have validated our simulator with industry partners, including Northern Lights and Schlumberger, and made it available as open source software for use by other researchers.","Microsoft's data-driven and precision agriculture solutions enable more sustainable decision making for farmers.

Pursuing climate solutions through computational foundations The Microsoft Climate Research Initiative (MCRI), launched in June 2022, aims to advance the computational foundations, partnerships, and tools needed to achieve a carbon","negative future globally. Together with external sustainability experts, Microsoft scientists identified fundamental bottlenecks to mitigating and adapting to the climate crisis. To pursue solutions, researchers then narrowed their focus to bottlenecks for which computational approaches, such as those pursued by AI4Science, could be transformative. From this analysis, researchers selected three priority focus areas: reliable accounting of carbon emissions, materials engineering for carbon removal and reduction, and climate risk assessment. MCRI now supports projects in these three areas with collaboration between Microsoft researchers and external academics and is establishing a global community of research partners to complement Microsoft's internal computational expertise","and infrastructure. A complete list of MCRI projects is available on our website. Improving carbon accounting Microsoft convened a global team of experts to identify and overcome the biggest constraints to reliable carbon accounting. The results were published in Nature. One key issue identified is the difficulty of accurately assessing the effects of decarbonization policies and investments. In many parts of the world, monitoring the effect of carbon reduction policies is hampered by the lack of real-time, localized carbon emissions measurements. Last year, we reported on our university collaboration that used neural networks (AI models) to develop more accurate and","significantly faster simulations of the complex, nonlinear relationship from historical carbon emissions to atmospheric carbon concentrations. With funding from MCRI, we have expanded these efforts to make the data and technology improvements needed to develop an AI model to predict localized carbon emissions from abundant data on atmospheric carbon concentrations.

Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix 69 | | | Science and research (continued) Engineering materials for carbon removal and reduction Direct capture of carbon from ambient air is a technology with great promise, but scaling it requires efficiency and cost improvements. We're using AI to identify materials that can lead to such improvements. Metal-organic frameworks are a class of materials that can balance the tradeoff between adsorbing significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the energy required to release the adsorbed molecules for cost-effective storage or reuse. Researchers at Microsoft","and the University of California, Berkeley are collaborating to use AI methods to find optimal metal-organic materials that balance this tradeoff and offer other properties required for economic and safe carbon removal. Strengthening nature-based solutions for climate Restoring and protecting nature is vital to reaching net zero, while building resilience to climate change is already underway. However, it can be difficult to properly measure and account for the climate benefit of investments in nature. We are collaborating with scientists and research institutions around the world to improve measurement and accounting methods for nature's contribution to climate solutions. For example, through","collaborations with researchers at Concordia and Simon Fraser universities, we demonstrated that temporary carbon stored in nature can lead to permanent climate benefits by reducing peak warming, as long as it is pursued as a complement to emissions reductions. This work was published in Nature's Communications Earth and Environment journal. Harnessing the power of AI, we are helping to manage global climate risk and build climate resilience. We are collaborating with scientists and research institutions around the world to improve measurement and accounting methods for climate solutions. Assessing climate risk Most climate risk assessments today do not adequately reflect the","true exposure of society and businesses to climate-related risk, as explained by Microsoft and global experts in a Nature Communications paper. The development and applications of emerging science and technologies can help drive a step change in climate risk assessments.

Expanding our geographic focus can ensure that climate","solutions benefit underserved communities and markets. Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix 72 | | | Policy and advocacy Using our voice to advocate for net zero We believe that Microsoft and the broader private sector have an important role to play in advocating for effective and innovative sustainability policies. When we announced our commitment in 2020 to become carbon negative by 2030, we pledged to use our voice on public policy issues to help advance global decarbonization efforts. We understand that public policies will play a critical role, both in creating signals to","spur the economic and social transition required to address climate change and in building the foundations of markets to develop and deliver innovative goods, services, and skills to achieve that transition. However, there is a growing gap between the pace of desired policy outcomes and economic and scientific indicators that show accelerating climate impacts. To help close this gap and support communities and companies in their efforts to achieve their climate pledges, governments around the world need to accelerate policy action. Key projects Advocating for robust policy in carbon, electricity, water, waste, and ecosystems Over the past year we have","deepened our policy engagement on carbon, electricity, waste, and ecosystems. In the United States, we advocated for climate and energy investments as part of the recent US infrastructure and climate laws, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition, we shared our support for a robust and consistent framework for climate disclosure requirements by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and provided comments to the requests for information climate disclosure for US federal procurement. Microsoft continued to encourage tree planting and reforestation efforts through our support of the Trillion Trees Act, as well as","efforts to improve the health of old-growth forests by supporting the Save Our Sequoias Act. At the state level, we supported legislative and regulatory efforts to accelerate the clean energy transition by encouraging the integration of zero-emission generation and improving the resilience of the electric grid. We continue to use our voice on public policy issues to help advance global decarbonization efforts. In the European Union, we supported a comprehensive decarbonization plan with ambitious measures to scale uptake of renewable energy, and informed Europe's emergency measures to face the energy crisis. We actively engaged in the development of the regulatory","framework for the certification of carbon removals, calling for strict standards for high-quality, accountable, and long-lasting carbon removals. As Europe leads the way on upgraded transparency and disclosure of environmental, social, and governance information across global value chains, we have endorsed the buildout of a level playing field for corporate sustainability reporting. We have also engaged and supported the drive to increase the circularity of devices, boost transparency and efficiency in waste management policies, and empower consumers with better information. Globally, Microsoft advocated for public policies to accelerate climate action; invest in mitigation, adaptation, and a just transition; and align","international climate reporting and disclosure rules. At COP27, Microsoft called on countries to remain committed to the target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. In response to the UN Secretary-General's call to action to develop early warning systems for all within the next five years, Microsoft joined global leaders in support of this initiative while highlighting the fundamental role that technology can play in these efforts. Advocating for social and economic policies that address climate change is pivotal to our sustainability journey. Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Customer sustainability Global sustainability Appendix ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ......","...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... 73 | | | Policy and advocacy (continued) Sharing principles that guide our policy work in carbon and electricity To support our policy work, we published briefs on carbon and electricity policy to share the priorities and principles that guide Microsoft's policy advocacy work around the world. The principles we set forth are grounded in our focus on achieving tangible results, enabling a flexible rather than one-size- fits-all approach, and recognizing the important role that digital technologies will play as we expand market opportunities for all. We developed these two","policy briefs together to underscore the integral and complementary role that electricity policy plays in addressing climate change. We also recognize that there are critical energy issues that go beyond climate change such as the availability of electricity for all, affordability, and environmental justice. Similarly, there are carbon issues that go beyond energy. As we tackle these issues in parallel, we are mindful that our policy work will need to expand in the future and consider these policy briefs as foundations for future work on issues like water and waste. Making green jobs, skills, and entrepreneurship central to climate action","Using its Economic Graph insights, LinkedIn embarked on a major research initiative focused on the rise and proliferation of green skills throughout the labor market. The 2022 Global Green Skills Report brings this research into focus through two key findings: 1) demand for green skills is on track to outpace supply, and 2) not only are green jobs growing, but also green skills are becoming increasingly common across existing jobs that are not traditionally thought of as green. At COP26, LinkedIn announced it would be one of the founding partners on the U.S. State Department's Connecting Climate Entrepreneurs initiative, through","which the US government will catalyze resources to support job growth by climate entrepreneurs in the global south.
