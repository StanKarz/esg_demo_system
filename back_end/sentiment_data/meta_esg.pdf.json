But the task ahead is massive.","As both a company and a platform for social connection, we take our responsibility seriously. We’ll continue our sustainability work across our business and products—and will share our progress through reports like this one. At Meta, we’re building technology that will help shape the next chapter of the internet and the future of social connection. These long-term investments are in service of a vision for the future where everyone can be present with each other, create new opportunities, and experience new things. We view our sustainability work with this same eye to the future. After all, the possibilities that our","technology will unlock for people only matter if we have a safe and thriving planet. We think about our work here in three areas: limiting the environmental footprint of our operations and devices; driving climate action with our products; and forming partnerships to scale our impact. On our operations, thanks to innovations in our data center and office designs, we’ve driven up efficiency and driven down our environmental footprint. But we have more work to do. We’ve achieved net zero emissions in our global operations and set a goal to reach net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030.","We’ve also set an ambitious goal for our global operations to be water positive by 2030, meaning we’ll restore more water than we consume. On driving climate action, we’ve expanded our Climate Science Center to reach millions of people around the world with authoritative information about climate change. And we’re working closely with experts to combat false or misleading information. On partnerships to scale our impact, we recently announced a joint $925 million commitment alongside Stripe, Shopify, McKinsey, and Alphabet to accelerate the development of carbon removal technologies over the next 9 years. This is just one of many ways","we’re collaborating with others across industry, nonprofit, academia, and government to combine forces for greater impact. Our 2021 Sustainability Report dives deep on the progress we’re making across these areas. As we work to provide people around the world with equitable access to opportunities, we’ve also committed to upholding the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles and to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. We’re committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights too. Sustainability, human rights, economic opportunity—these are all interconnected and we’re taking a holistic approach to make sure we’re driving positive change globally. The defining quality","of the metaverse will be a feeling of presence—like you are right there with another person or in another place. That feeling of presence is an incredibly powerful tool to build empathy, understanding, and collaboration. Students will be able to take field trips to the melting ice caps or a wind farm, without leaving their classroom. Journalists will be able to tell immersive, first-person stories of climate refugees that help their audience feel the impact on people’s lives. Experts from around the world can get together around a virtual table to discuss solutions and advance climate action. 2021 Meta Sustainability","Report 4 Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. The surge in traffic we observed on our platforms when the COVID-19 pandemic began demonstrated the ever-growing role Meta plays in keeping people connected across the world. Meaningful connections are not possible without a safe and healthy world—one in which diverse experiences are respected, accurate information is amplified over the noise, and bold climate action is truly making a difference. We can all agree that changes to global temperature and climate present overwhelming challenges—both environmental and social. We take our role,","and the responsibility that comes with it, seriously. At our core, we strive to protect both people and the planet through responsible operations. For the last decade, we have invested in ways to make our own operations more water-and energy-efficient with a focus on sustainable solutions for the resources we do use. Put simply, we aim to use less—less water and less energy—and to reduce unnecessary waste. As of 2020, our global operations reached net zero emissions and are supported by 100% renewable energy. We are now reaching toward the goals of net zero emissions across our value chain and","becoming water positive throughout our operations, aiming to achieve both of these milestones in 2030. Although this report looks back on 2021 and all the progress we have made, I cannot help looking forward and thinking about all the questions yet to be answered and the work yet to be done. One thing that became clear in 2021 as we mapped out our net zero strategy was the difficulty in driving pathways for consistent reductions across our operations for a rapidly growing business. We know our Scope 3 emissions are increasing—and will continue to increase in the near term—as we","grow to support the global demand for the services we provide. For example, to support the infrastructure necessary to connect people around the world, we are building more data centers and networks that will provide capacity and reliability on our platforms, and will enable our transition to the metaverse. We will work to address our Scope 3 emissions by optimizing for low carbon in our business decisions, collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions and exploring interventions that decarbonize our broader value chain, both upstream and downstream. In addition to focusing on carbon reductions, we realize the need to be","innovative and push for new ways to collaborate with others. After all, the challenge of reaching net zero is an industry- wide problem, and as an industry, we will need to collectively realize our goals for the climate by working together. A Message from Rachel Peterson Vice President of Infrastructure About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 5 Our recent investment in Frontier AMC↗ is just one example of our belief that we can do far more for the climate through industry collaborations—and the ways","we are working with corporate partners to push for faster advancement of technological carbon removals. We continue to partner with leading thinkers to develop new ways to accelerate adoption of sustainable materials and fuels for construction, hardware and transportation. Industry leaders, governments and other stakeholders know that Scope 3 emissions are difficult to measure and reduce. We remain committed to leading internal and external discussions and partnerships to drive industry standards and reductions throughout our value chain. Finally, as we look forward, we believe that we must build on achieving our 100% renewable energy goals by optimizing our energy strategy","to drive emissions reductions at a grid-scale. We will do this by maintaining our commitment to 100% renewable energy; creating innovative approaches to drive emissions out of the sector while improving reliability; and collaborating with peers, grid operators, utilities and other stakeholders to advance the zero emissions, reliable grid of the future. Despite the unknowns, from the planning and analysis we completed in 2021, we know our ambitious 2030 targets will require significant shifts in how we build infrastructure, increase operational discipline and invest in existing and emerging nature- based and technological solutions to reduce and remove emissions. We will","work to do all of this while growing our business to meet the demands of tomorrow. We are humbled by these challenges and grateful to be part of a community of climate leaders, sustainability-focused organizations, government leaders and committed corporations all coming together to allow us to scale our efforts and enable bold climate action. This is hard and very important work. It is how we will bring the world closer together—and together, how we will help the world move closer to better. Switching to a clean economy could raise $2.8 trillion through carbon price revenues and the redirection of","fossil fuel subsidies to public investments. A MESSAGE FROM RACHEL PETERSON About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 6 What is your vision for the future of Meta’s sustainability strategy? We have made a lot of progress over the past decade—driving up efficiency and driving down our environmental footprint, especially in how we design, build and operate our global offices and data centers. But, we have so much more important work to do. For example, we have worked for years to drive sustainability into our","value chain through our responsible supply chain program. Meta’s sustainability strategy in the coming years will be to expand our value chain and partnership programs to Q&A with Edward Palmieri Director of Global Sustainability Edward Palmieri joined Meta in 2010 and served as a member of the company’s legal team for many years, while nurturing his passion for environmental justice and sustainability. As a new parent, Palmieri decided it was time for a shift in career focus. He joined Meta’s Global Sustainability team as Director, allowing him to merge his work with his passion. include working with internal Meta teams","and our global partners to fight climate change through emissions reductions and removals, water stewardship and biodiversity projects, and meaningful collaborations to invest in new solutions and scale our work. Our strategy comes to life through three pillars: 1. How We Operate—protecting the well-being of people and our planet through our processes, operations and global supply chain 2. What We Create—amplifying scientists and climate leaders through our products and platforms 3. How We Collaborate—engaging with experts and supporting established initiatives in the climate space How is Meta approaching its journey to net zero value chain emissions? We embrace our responsibility","as a global company to address the climate challenge that impacts us all. On our journey to reach net zero emissions across our value chain, we will lead by example while following what science tells us must be done to align with the Paris Agreement. We are focusing on reducing our Scope 3 emissions, which means radically changing the way we operate and helping our suppliers to set their own climate targets. This work to use less, choose better, embrace low-carbon technology and collaborate with our suppliers will be a very long and complex journey. For us, our net zero","goal is more than an announcement; it is a program designed to drive real emissions reductions and lasting changes to our infrastructure and supply chain. How will the metaverse impact sustainability? At Meta, we are committed to building tools that make choosing to connect virtually easier than ever. And while we are at the beginning of what will be a long and constantly changing journey, we are excited about giving people the ability to choose options that have a smaller environmental impact. Still, the metaverse is new and the growth of our business to support the creation of these new","tools presents challenges. The expansion of hardware, construction and operation of new data centers and other capital goods means that we must continue to drive toward more sustainable construction and operational business practices. About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 7 We are now beginning to investigate how we can support our business growth while integrating with low-carbon technology, renewable energy, hardware circularity, reduced water usage and other climate- conscious initiatives included in this report. Despite all the progress we are making and our plans","for the future, the path to a sustainable metaverse will not always be easy. For example, at first, we expect to see an increase in our emissions. But, ultimately, the work we are doing during these foundational years will drive the innovation and collaboration across our business that enables us to grow sustainably. How are the sustainability and human rights agendas connected at Meta? The shared values and aspirations of the human rights and environmental movements are increasingly apparent. The primary victims of environmental harm are often marginalized communities where people cannot claim their rights to live in a healthy","environment. Linking our sustainability and Q&A WITH EDWARD PALMIERI human rights agendas at Meta is an important step forward— whether that means taking into consideration the populations most impacted by transitioning to a zero-carbon economy or investing in the well-being of workers across our supply chain. Not only is this the right thing to do but also it signals to our employees and stakeholders that we are committed to protecting the rights we all deserve. What gives you confidence that Meta can be a driving force for industry change? Our people and our commitment to real impact at scale give","me confidence. With the technical and professional talent we have assembled, our team is poised to evolve the way Meta and the technology industry approach sustainability. Our employees truly care about this. Sustainability is not an add-on for us. It is a driving force in itself that motivates innovation in what we do and how we do it. Our scale also gives me confidence. We have the global reach, expertise and platforms to make a meaningful difference in markets. We are working to support lower-emissions solutions across our business, which we believe will translate to market availability for others as","well. We are doing this through our own direct investments (like with our renewable energy projects) and through partnerships (like our investments in carbon removal and reduction solutions and technologies). In fact, one of the most wonderful things about working in the sustainability field is how collaborative it is. When we look at the Open Compute Project↗, for example, we have seen the power of collaboration. I know we can do even more to set an example for better technologies and capacity-building in our supply chain. At Meta, we are building tools that make choosing to connect virtually easier than","ever. 1,200+ companies have set science-based targets in line with net zero emissions.

About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 27 Expanding Net Zero from our Operations to our Value Chain On our path to net zero value chain emissions in 2030, we are committed to an approach that prioritizes","emissions reductions. Key strategies to reduce emissions include using fewer new materials by reusing server hardware components and choosing construction materials with a smaller emissions footprint, such as low-carbon concrete. We began working with a select group of our suppliers in 2021 to calculate and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2022, we will provide capacity- building training to our top 100 suppliers on measuring their GHG impact, setting reduction goals and identifying ways to reduce their emissions. To address any emissions we cannot reduce, we will remove an equivalent amount of GHG emissions through verified carbon removal projects","that prioritize social and environmental benefits. 2021 HIGHLIGHTS Scope 1 covers direct emissions that come from sources that are owned or controlled by Meta. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the purchased or acquired energy consumed by Meta.

How We Operate About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We","Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 30 Because climate-related issues are inherently uncertain, assessing risks and evaluating actions is an ongoing process. For the last decade, we have invested in ways to minimize our footprint, champion renewable energy, restore water supplies and support climate justice. As of 2020, our global operations have reached net zero emissions and are supported by 100% renewable energy2. To maintain forward progress as our business grows and evolves, we regularly conduct climate-related risk and opportunity assessments to better understand and manage future transitional and physical risks associated","with climate change. This helps us take the right measures that contribute to our company’s and our world’s resilience. To guide our work, in 2021, we incorporated recommendations of the Task Force on Climate- Related Financial Disclosures. This process helps provide a view into how we understand and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change, and it informs how we prepare to navigate the evolving disclosure landscape (including potential U.S. and EU regulations and requirements). We are committed to completing a full TCFD scenario planning in 2022. Transitional risks can occur as businesses recalibrate to a cleaner, green","economy. To assess our transitional climate risks, we consider potential changes to climate policies as well as technological, market and reputational risks.

RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN Meta is part of a","complex value chain that touches lives and communities around the globe. Our Responsible Supply Chain (RSC) program strives to empower workers and protect the environment—through open and frequent communication with our suppliers, deep understanding of core sustainability issues and initiatives that support safe, healthy and fair working conditions. Our approach begins with establishing clear expectations with our suppliers through our standards and policies, including the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct↗. The RBA Code of Conduct, Meta’s Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking statement↗ and Meta’s Conflict Minerals Policy↗ serve as some of the RSC program’s core tenets and are a","guidepost for the expectations we set with our suppliers.

Assessments come","in multifaceted forms that include independent audits, supplier questionnaires, on-site visits or conversations. In 2021, we continued to identify meaningful areas of improvement by engaging with workers directly through mobile surveys that provided key worker sentiment. Surveys have led to improvements in worker satisfaction through focus group discussions, stronger new employee onboarding and improved grievance mechanisms and analysis. We have taken a more holistic approach to worker well-being thanks to survey feedback that includes physical and emotional health and ideas for managing stress. Meta experts address identified issues with direct supplier engagement and corrective action. When needed, we also look","to external partners for support in the areas of labor, health and safety to help suppliers identify areas for improvement and create structured action plans with measurable outcomes. Net Zero Supplier Engagement “For a Better Reality” is about building a better future. Business as usual must fundamentally change to move away from what is obviously an unsustainable path. This shift is an enormous undertaking affecting all levels of the supply chain, an undertaking even a company the size of Meta cannot tackle alone. What we can control right now is how we operate, what we create and how we collaborate","to collectively solve this giant challenge. We have developed a supplier engagement program to help us reach net zero emissions across RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN our value chain in 2030.

Our Happiness Series is an initiative launched in 2020 that strives to increase supply chain worker morale and sense of belonging. In 2021, our team worked to deepen their understanding of what workers want from their jobs and their lives and what they are passionate about. After spending time at a supplier factory in China, our team was inspired by the employees’ vast interest in education for personal growth and investment in their families. To honor the workers’ commitment to their families","and to encourage them to focus on enriching their own lives, we installed a “smart” library at the factory. More than 11,000 workers can access nearly 2,000 books—books that empower women to take control of their own destiny and books workers can share with their children. We engaged with 40 suppliers in 2021 to identify GHG reduction opportunities within their operations. For example, we conducted an energy-efficiency assessment for a data center hardware supplier in 2021. We identified nearly 9,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of potential annual energy savings within the supplier’s mechanical and electrical facility-level equipment. Potential projects include installing","higher efficiency equipment, replacing valves and damaged insulation, and implementing automatic variable operation controls for chilled water pumps and air handling units. The facility will be able to save not only energy (and related indirect emissions) but also energy costs, with payback periods ranging from less than one year to up to four years. Assessing resilience to climate change is crucial to ensuring our supply chain is prepared for climate risks. We are also working with suppliers to ensure they understand the climate risks they may face, including floods, heat stress, typhoons, hurricanes, water stress and sea-level rise. Assessing resilience","to climate change is crucial to guiding our efforts to ensure the people and communities within our supply chain are prepared for climate risks. “The Happiness Series extends beyond code compliance,” explained Leslie Collins, Head of Responsible Supply Chain Sustainability for Meta. “It’s about wanting to do good and working to elevate joy in the lives of workers.” Supply chain emissions are, on average, 11.4 times higher than operational emissions.

One method we use to conserve water is through direct evaporative cooling, which relies on outside air. Traditional technologies, like chilled water plants and cooling towers, rely on water to reject heat. In areas facing specific environmental challenges, such as high levels of dust, extreme humidity or elevated salinity, using","direct cooling could severely impact IT equipment. In these cases, we use indirect cooling systems to minimize the risk to our buildings and the servers housed within. In partnership with Nortek Air Solutions, we have developed an indirect cooling technology called the StatePoint Liquid Cooling (SPLC) system↗. The first of its kind to be deployed to data centers, SPLC produces cold water instead of cold air. The system uses less water than a typical indirect cooling system because it uses air to cool water instead of using water to cool air. Based on evaluation of our current water use, we","have identified winter humidification needs as an area of opportunity to further improve our operating efficiency by optimizing our relative humidity (RH). We piloted the RH adjustment↗ at our data center in Los Lunas, New Mexico, and found by lowering our current 20% minimum RH to 13% minimum RH, we were able to reduce water use by 40% over nine months. We have rolled out the RH minimum changes across our existing data centers and updated design standards for new construction.

To lower the carbon impact of concrete—a large source of global GHG emissions—we expanded our partnership with researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s civil engineering and computer science departments to use an artificial intelligence (AI) model to generate low-carbon mix designs↗. These alternatives use high amounts of byproducts from other industries, such as fly ash and slag, as a replacement for cement. We incorporated lessons learned from the first pilot phase to train the model’s AI to identify concrete mixes","that optimize for early strength gain while lowering the carbon footprint. We also piloted the use of recycled ground glass as a substitute for cement in various concrete applications in our data center locations in northern Huntsville, Alabama, and Gallatin, Tennessee. These pilots explored the feasibility of replacing cement with powdered glass from products such as bottles or window-panes that would otherwise end up in landfills.

The projects studied total 5,763 MW—some of which are operating today and others that will come online over the next three years—and represent an estimated $7.4 billion in investment. During construction, these renewable energy projects have supported or will support over 42,000 jobs across the country and contribute more than $4.3 billion in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Our portfolio of","solar and wind projects spans 18 states and 46 counties, and many of these projects have benefited under- resourced communities. Of the 55 U.S. solar and wind projects in our portfolio studied, 96% Energy Storage Demand for electricity varies significantly throughout the day. Fossil fuel generators can be quickly activated or deactivated to account for these variations. Renewable energy technology, like wind and solar, are weather-dependent, so they do not necessarily match the variations in electricity demand on their own. However, energy storage can help to smooth the small deviations in energy production on the system to help integrate greater","volumes of renewable energy. Additionally, to prevent wasted energy when demand is low on sunny or windy days, and to support grid reliability on cloudy, calm days, large-scale storage is critical. Adding energy storage to the grid is an important tool that enables utilities to move the electricity produced from a solar project, for instance, into times of the day when sunshine is not available. This provides greater reliability and flexibility to the utility system and enables a much lower carbon footprint, as utilities integrate even more renewable energy on their grids. Meta is also providing funding for added storage","to local utilities, allowing them to prepare for and transition to the zero-carbon grid of tomorrow. Near our Los Lunas data center in Valencia County, New Mexico, we partnered with our local utility, Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), to add 50 MW of battery storage alongside the addition of 240 MW of solar through our innovative green tariff. This unique commercial structure allows customers like us to directly pay for capacity resources like energy storage to offset the need to add nonrenewable energy resources to the system.

Along Oak Creek, 19 separate ditches divert irrigation water to residents. Although the ditches are important contributors to the local economy, most are more than 150 years old and limited capital exists to invest in infrastructure upgrades to meet the needs of water users and aquatic habitat. The Mason Lane Ditch provides water to over 220 acres of irrigated land along its five-mile path. Degradation throughout the canal resulted in leakage and seepage, threatening its ability to meet agricultural water needs. Erosion in one particular section of the canal formed several large","leaks, spilling seven cubic feet of water per second from the ditch and reducing Oak Creek’s flow by 15%.

At Connect 2021↗, our CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced Meta↗, which brings together our apps and technologies under one new company brand. The metaverse is an immersive, embodied successor to the mobile internet. Our focus will be to bring the metaverse to life, helping people connect, build communities, grow businesses and unlock new ways they can participate in the transition to a just, low-carbon economy. We are already developing exciting new technologies that will help people connect and explore in the metaverse, including our virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR)","and wearable hardware technologies and devices. Our net zero commitment↗ is inclusive of these products, and we are committed to building the metaverse sustainably. In 2021, we began conducting LCAs of our Reality Labs products, including Quest 2, to better understand the environmental impacts associated with each phase in the product life cycle—materials, transportation, use phase and end of life. These LCAs enable teams to identify opportunities to incorporate circularity and reduce GHG emissions in our product development process. Augmented reality uses a real-world setting while virtual reality is completely virtual. About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create","How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 70 BUILDING THE METAVERSE The Reality Labs team has already started on our journey to move the needle toward reducing the carbon footprint of our products, including: Evaluating opportunities to incorporate plastics and metals with recycled content into products as these materials are available Prioritizing the use of FSC↗ or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification↗ certified fibers in our consumer packaging Transitioning segments of our logistics network to lower-carbon modes of transit, such as leveraging ocean freight instead of air freight Educating product development teams","on hardware circularity principles through release of our internal Design for Circularity guide, with the intent of continuing to reduce waste, enable disassembly and improve material recovery Meta is committed to doing our part to extend the life of our products. In 2021, we launched our Meta Quest “As Good As New↗” program, enabling customers to purchase refurbished products for our flagship devices, including Quest 1 and Quest 2. These devices have all the same features, performance and quality, while also giving our gently used products new life. Allowing customers to purchase refurbished products for our devices delivers the same","user experience while giving gently used products new life. The impact from refurbishing a device is, on average, three times less than that of producing a new device.

How We Collaborate About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 72 We must work together to realize systems-level change. HOW WE COLLABORATE Collaboration is core to everything","we do. Throughout this report, we have shared example after example of how partnerships enable us to use our size and scale to make a lasting positive impact. It will take everyone to make the systems-level changes required for a better reality: world-class experts in sustainability and social issues, climate leaders, academic researchers, local utilities, community nonprofits, suppliers and every one of our thousands of employees. Here is a closer look at how we build new collaborations and support established initiatives, inside and outside of Meta. Almost 90% of employees engaged in their company’s sustainability work say it enhances their","job satisfaction. About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 73 We empower employees to see themselves as part of the climate solution. Meta’s employees are integral to the success of our company’s bottom line and to championing our company’s culture, so the success of our sustainability program depends on having employee voices at the table. We invite all employees to join our efforts by participating in executive Q&A sessions, educational training, local Green@ chapters or climate-focused hackathons. No matter their role at Meta, we empower","employees to see themselves as part of the climate solution through year-round programming. In 2021, we offered several powerful new initiatives to engage and activate employees in fresh ways. INTERNAL ENGAGEMENT “To me, sustainability is the lens through which we need to view our future,” said Christian Monzon, Technical Program Manager for Meta. “I feel a responsibility to do my part in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable solutions where I can. Meta’s core sustainability department is driving tremendously impactful work, but we would be significantly limiting our impact potential if we didn’t also create advocates and champions among our","70,000+ employees. I help lead 12 Green@ chapters based in the Americas with the goal of fostering Meta’s sustainability culture by introducing and encouraging sustainable choices and behaviors for all Metamates on and off our campuses,” Christian continued. Corporate collaborations are most effective when they resolve an issue that is seen as critical to business continuity. About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 74 INTERNAL ENGAGEMENT SustainabiliTEA Talks In 2021, we launched SustainabiliTEA Talks, a new live executive Q&A series on our internal communications platform,","where Meta sustainability leaders engage in a dialogue about their personal passions, program work and ways for employees to get involved. Through this interactive forum, driven by employee questions, the broader community gets to see an honest portrayal of the challenges and opportunities in this space. Our first session featured Meta’s net zero 2030 program and ways employees can contribute to reducing company emissions. Our second session highlighted Meta’s participation in COP26 with policy leaders in the U.S. and Europe. Earth Week, Climate Week and Sustainability Summit In April 2021, we organized our third annual Earth Week Celebration, held live","on our internal communications platform. Over five days, we hosted 12 live events, expanded global content across Europe and Asia, and initiated a virtual marketplace with 50 global vendors and the first #MyCarbonCounts employee action campaign to help individuals identify their biggest carbon usage categories and reduce their footprint. In September 2021, we held our second Climate and Sustainability Summit, in alignment with Meta’s Climate Week activations. This one-day virtual conference highlighted programming across Meta and celebrated the cross-functional teams that make this work a reality. Climate Reality Project Leadership Corps It is critical not only to connect employees with","Meta’s sustainability strategy and programming but also to provide access to the best-in-class educational resources. In 2021, we partnered with Climate Reality Project Leadership Corps↗, Al Gore’s premiere training organization, to promote five different global week-long trainings and give our employees the opportunity to view their work and personal activities through the lens of climate justice. Hackathons At Meta, many of our best and brightest ideas are born from company hackathons—these events are a core part of our culture that feed innovation into our sustainability programs as well. For the past five years, we have been working alongside a community","of 500+ Sustainability Hackers to apply their technical expertise to product ideas for rapid iteration and fast feedback. In 2021, we co-sponsored the Fall Hackathon for a second year. We had a total of eight projects put forth across the U.S. and EMEA, with 85 hackers participating. We also centralized all employee resources (for learning, action and engagement) into a single, internal wiki page. In 2022, we look forward to expanding education opportunities for employees hoping to level up their climate action, climate science literacy and understanding of Meta’s climate goals. Employee Activation Across Meta, employees are integrating climate action","into daily activities. Employees focused on local community action continued to grow our global Green@ chapters. Employee activation and discussion on Workplace led to expansion of major activations for Earth Day, Climate Week and executive Q&As. Employee advocacy inspired many to promote and enroll in the Climate Reality Project education series. And employees leveraged their technical expertise to sponsor the Fall Hackathon for the second year in a row.

In 2021, we joined the Rio Grande Water Fund↗ and the Texas Water Action Collaborative↗, both of which bring together nonprofit organizations, companies and other stakeholders to address shared water challenges. We also committed to funding the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100)↗, a country-led effort to bring 100 million hectares of land in","Africa into restoration by 2030. Instagram partnered, through providing ad credit, with the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)↗ to support Children, Cities and Climate↗, a study focusing on the intersection of climate change, cities, health and young people. LSHTM researchers carried out a global survey of over 3,000 young people and their parents to understand their views on the cities they live in and the EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS air they breathe, using promoted social media advertisements on Facebook and Instagram to recruit participants. The research also included an analysis of the child health benefits of improving air quality","in 16 global cities, and a literature review of the child health benefits of decarbonization. Climate change is a challenge too great for any of us to solve alone. But, by coming together, we have the power to make sustainable change. About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 77 We also worked with The Recycling Partnership↗ to create Communities for Recycling↗, a personalized Messenger experience↗ that provides recycling information based on where a person lives—and to intuitively improve recycling accuracy. Following are additional organizations that","Meta partners with or is a member of, focused on various aspects of sustainability and climate action. Aqueduct Alliance We are members of the World Resources Institute (WRI)’s Aqueduct Alliance↗, a group of leading companies, governments and foundations, to gain strategic guidance and industry insight from the WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas team and water stewardship activities. Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions In 2021, we joined the Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions (BASCS)↗, a business-driven collaboration for climate solutions that generate results at the scale our world needs. This group provides a central, neutral platform for businesses and","experts to meet, learn, discuss and act together as a “community of practice.” Open Compute Project The Open Compute Project (OCP)↗ is a collaborative community focused on redesigning hardware technology to efficiently support the growing demands on compute infrastructure. Sustainability and circularity were identified as 2021 strategic initiatives for OCP. Recognizing the role we can play in galvanizing collaboration within the information and communication technology (ICT) sector, Meta helped lead the scoping and definition of the strategic initiative, helping co-author the community’s first white paper↗ dedicated to a call to action on climate change. Responsible Business Alliance Founded in 2004","by a group of leading electronics companies, the RBA↗ is a nonprofit comprising electronics, retail, auto and toy companies committed to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities worldwide affected by the global supply chain. RBA members commit and are held accountable to a common Code of Conduct and use a range of RBA training and assessment tools to support continual improvement in the social, environmental and ethical responsibility of their supply chains. EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS Leadership About Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Appendix Vision The Environmental Sustainability Workgroup (ESWG)↗ within","the RBA convenes members to identify pressing environmental issues in climate change, water and waste, and collaborate on solutions that drive improvement not only within their organizations but also throughout their supply chains. In 2021, we provided a case study to a Chatham House Rules discussion with members to share our approach to both reporting and calculation of Scope 3 emissions. We were also actively involved in the Circular Materials Taskforce↗, which aims to help members adapt their business models and products to the circular economy by supporting integrated, international supply chains that further circular material use and protect human","rights and the environment. The Open Compute Project is a collaborative community focused on sharing solutions to efficiently support the growing demands on infrastructure. “Conflict minerals” include the metals tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, which are often collectively referred to as “3TG”. About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 78 Responsible Minerals Initiative The Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)↗ is one of the most used and respected resources for companies addressing issues related to the responsible sourcing of minerals in their supply chains. RMI is a","multi-industry initiative that promotes an understanding of and commitment to mitigating the impacts of extracting and processing raw materials. We maintain a Conflict Minerals Policy↗ and expect our suppliers to conduct their operations pursuant to this policy. EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS Other Key Memberships We are also proud to be members of other environmental nonprofit trade organizations, supporting their work to advance clean technologies and climate action policies that support economy- wide decarbonization and climate resiliency, including: Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA)↗ American Council on Renewable Energy↗ Advanced Energy Economy↗ Responsible Labor Initiative The Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI)↗ is a multi-industry, multi-stakeholder","initiative focused on ensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labor in global supply chains are consistently respected and promoted.

About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 79 ADVANCING INDUSTRY CHANGE Comprehensive climate and clean energy policy is central to avoiding the impacts of climate change. Climate action is critical to achieving a sustainable economy and protecting our planet. We are working internally to decarbonize","our operations and supply chain and to reduce our overall environmental footprint. Beyond our operations, we engage with climate-focused stakeholders, organizations and policymakers to advance stewardship, climate science and policies that will help move us all closer to a cleaner and decarbonized world. We know that industry, regulatory and stakeholder engagement are critical to realizing our own net zero goals and the progress the world needs to achieve in the coming years. Comprehensive and well-designed climate and clean energy policy is central to transitioning to a future that avoids the worst impacts of climate change. In 2021, Meta showed support","for key policies in the U.S. and Europe to advance sustainable policies and climate action. In the U.S., we actively participate in organizations that advocate for policies that will spur further clean energy deployment and decarbonize the electric sector as a whole. Meta endorsed the Climate Action Now Act (HR 9)↗ in the 116th United States Congress. About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 80 Our goal is not just to be one of the most sustainable companies but also to make it easier for","our users and employees to live more sustainably. ADVANCING INDUSTRY CHANGE In January 2021, we supported the call to the federal government↗ to prioritize transitioning to a zero-carbon energy economy led by CEBA. And, in October 2021, we released a public statement↗ where we called on Congress to support the climate and clean energy provisions within the Build Back Better Act↗ and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act↗. Meta is also fully committed to supporting the European Green Deal↗, which provides the framework toward a more sustainable and climate-neutral Europe by 2050. We are partnering with the European Union and the","governments across the EU in making the ambitions of the Green Deal a reality. In 2021, Meta joined the EU’s European Climate Pact↗, which aims to engage European citizens on climate action, and we supported the Corporate Leaders Group↗ sign-on letter in support of the EU Nationally Determined Contribution. Being a leader in the fight against climate change means bringing our industry forward with us by actively sharing strategies and ideas with the broader technology industry, as well as across other industries that face similar challenges. Enabling Climate Change Conversations From official events to tackling misinformation on a daily basis,","we are using our platforms to enable crucial conversations about climate change. Our goal is not just to be one of the most sustainable companies but also to make it easier for our users and employees to live more sustainably. Our work in the lead-up to and during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)↗ demonstrates the way our platforms can serve as powerful tools to generate support for climate action. During COP26, we featured experts and scientists in new content designed to inform and inspire action. We hosted a Facebook and Instagram Live studio at the UNFCCC","pavilion, which included over 90 conversations with leading voices on climate change. We featured the Say it with Science conversation series on the Climate Science Center on Facebook covering health and climate change. On Instagram, we launched the editorial series Our Planet in Crisis, which features the stories of activists and organizers who are dedicated to spreading awareness and empowering others to take action in their local communities. We also debuted a new video series in Asia focused on climate change, called Forward Together, which shared new Data for Good tools and research on climate change and stories from community","leaders in sustainability. About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 81 Climate Week We continue to do our part to support The Paris Climate Agreement through our ongoing involvement with organizations like The Climate Group. During Climate Week and the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 2021, we were able to connect thought leaders for a series of side events↗. During these sessions, we discussed some of the world’s most pressing issues, including communicating climate change, vaccine equity and the role of tech and open data","flows in economic prosperity. ADVANCING INDUSTRY CHANGE COP26 In 2021, Meta delivered our biggest activation at COP yet. At the core of our activation was our presence at the UNFCCC pavilion. Now in our sixth year, we ran a Facebook and Instagram Live Studio—a space for policymakers, advocates, businesses and nonprofits to broadcast progress, challenges and reflections on the urgency of climate change to audiences around the world. We had 90+ high-level visitors. At COP26, we executed over 40 initiatives. In addition to a massive expansion of the CSC, we supported the UN in mobilizing action against climate change and","encouraging conversations around this important topic. The UN’s ActNow chatbot was updated with 10 new actions for people to tackle climate change and was made available on Messenger and Instagram. In support of this important moment, Meta developed new camera stickers to help people strike up a conversation by visually showing their support for climate action in their Story or group chat on Messenger and Instagram. Our Meta delegation on the ground included team members from across the company and hosted: “Bridging the Gap between Climate Information and Action” in the Business Pavilion “How can ICT companies help enable Europe’s","transition to net zero emissions by 2050” in the EU Pavilion A Reuters event on authoritative climate information Roundtables with youth Ahead of COP26, Meta’s Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg, signed a Glasgow Is Our Business↗ open letter that urged governments and companies to join in signatories in making meaningful emissions commitments ahead of COP26. It ran as a full-page ad in The New York Times. Meta also joined the Clean Energy Demand Initiative (CEDI)↗, led by the U.S. Department of State and CEBA, which was launched at COP26. CEDI is intended to signal corporate clean energy demand in constrained","regions for renewable procurement, such as Asia-Pacific. As key climate policy issues continue to be widely debated by governments around the world, our increased and continuously evolving focus on sustainability and climate policy (including but not limited to the activities described in this report) represents our heightened level of engagement in and attention to these important topics.

Values are rounded and totals are calculated before rounding throughout this report. 2. “Other data center-related facilities” includes","facilities where Meta used less than 100,000 MWh of electricity in the reporting year, such as warehouses or colocation facilities. Owned, online data centers are always reported by site, even if they were below this threshold. 3. Meta’s methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions can be found here↗. 4. Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated annually based on the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol↗. 5. (a) Scope 1 includes emissions from diesel, natural gas and refrigerants from offices and data centers and from diesel and gasoline in the transportation fleet owned and controlled by Meta. (b) Scope","2 includes emissions from electricity of offices and warehouses leased, controlled and owned by Meta; electricity of data centers owned and leased (IT load) by Meta; natural gas of offices and warehouses leased and serviced by Meta; and purchased heat. Because Meta does not control building operations in leased data center facilities, as of 2017, only emissions associated with its IT load electricity are included in Scope 2 emissions. (c) Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions throughout Meta’s value chain. Starting in 2019, Meta included emissions from all relevant categories in Scope 3. Scope 3 emissions for 2015 to 2018","include business travel, employee commute and construction. 6. In the 2021 reporting year, two updates to reporting were applied to 2020 and later inventories: (a) Data from life cycle assessments for our hardware and sold products were used to calculate our Scope 3 emissions. (b) 2020 use of sold product numbers were recalculated to improve accuracy. 7. Prior to 2020, Meta invested in avoided emissions offsets which are not considered carbon removal. 8. In the 2019 reporting year, three updates to reporting were applied to 2017 (baseline year) and later inventories: (a) Vehicles operated by the Transportation team in support","of commuting and inter-campus travel were previously counted in Scope 3 – Employee commute. After re-visiting Meta’s operational control of these vehicles, it was determined that they should be accounted for in Scope 1. (b) It was determined that Meta overestimated natural gas emissions by including estimates for offices which do not in fact use natural gas. Recalculations have been applied to the inventory to remove these inaccuracies. (c) Fugitive emissions from refrigerant losses at offices not under Meta operational control were moved from Scope 2 to Scope 3. 9. In the 2020 reporting year, two emission factors updates significantly","impacted the GHG inventory: (a) Economic-Environmental Input-Output emission factors were updated and applied to relevant categories. 2019 numbers were updated to reflect these new emission factors. (b) Waste emission factors were updated and applied starting in 2020. 10. In the 2020 reporting year, two updates to the methodology were applied: (a) A new business travel methodology was developed, which was applied to 2019 and updated. Air travel still includes radiative forcing starting from 2017. (b) Employee commuting now includes telecommuting, or work-from-home, emissions starting in 2020, for which the electricity portion is matched with renewable energy. 11. Sustainable Aviation Fuel","was purchased in 2021 and associated emissions reductions are reflected in the inventory. 12. This includes the following categories in Scope 3: downstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, upstream leased assets, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Prior to 2020, emissions from use of sold products and upstream transportation and distribution are included in this category. 13. In owned and leased data center facilities included in Scope 2 and 3 emissions, Meta has matched building operations with renewable energy. 14. Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) and Water Use Effectiveness (WUE) is calculated based on best available data, including internal","meters, design estimates and utility bills where applicable. 15. Not included in Meta’s 2021 water withdrawal numbers are an additional 827,289 cubic meters of water withdrawn for the construction of Meta data centers.
