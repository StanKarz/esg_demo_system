making the transition to sourcing percent renewable electricity at our offices retail stores and data centers At Apple were acting with urgency to protect our planets limited resources and to be a leader in the fight against climate change Since weve been carbon neutral for our worldwide operations and by we plan to expand that progress to our entire supply chain and the lifetime use of our products And today nearly percent of the materials in our products were made from recycled content a number were working to increase Across our environmental work were also committed to being a force for equity Were working with communities on the frontlines of climate change and the next generation of diverse entrepreneurs to create shared opportunity and to build a more just world Our approach The environmental challenges we face today are significant and were responding with urgency and dedication We approach our work by focusing on fundamental questions What matters most And where can we make the greatest impact These questions guide our work across our strategic focus areas of climate change resources and smarter chemistry and inform our goals in how we can best achieve change We know were not alone in working to reduce our environmental footprint So were engaging with others to support our efforts and find opportunities to lift local communities along the way Setting ambitious goals is essential to our approach to drive the innovation and collaboration that makes change possible and to be transparent and accountable to our progress Our work is led by Lisa Jackson Apples Vice President of Environment Policy and Social Initiatives reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook The Environment Policy and Social Initiatives team works with other teams across Apple to set strategy engage stakeholders and communicate progress Our integrated approach means that decisions about the environment are reviewed and supported at the highest levels of the company Our Environmental Progress Report provides a detailed overview of our work and how were progressing toward our goals which we achieved in And in we reached the milestone of being carbon neutral for our corporate operations including direct emissions as well as business travel and employee commute Our 10year Climate Roadmap is addressing Apples carbon footprint through five pillars Lowcarbon design We will design products and manufacturing processes to be less carbonintensive through thoughtful material selection increased material efficiency and greater product energy efficiency Energy efficiency We will increase energy efficiency at our facilities and in our supply chain by finding opportunities such as retrofitting to reduce energy use Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Renewable electricity We will continue to source percent renewable electricity for our facilities and transition our entire supply chain to percent clean renewable sources of electricity Direct emissions abatement We will reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions in our facilities and our supply chain through process innovation emissions abatement and the use of nonfossilbased lowcarbon fuels Carbon removal Working in parallel with our emissions reduction efforts we will scale up investments in carbon removal projects including naturebased solutions that protect and restore ecosystems around the world Lowcarbon design To reduce the carbon footprint of our products were increasing efficiency and transitioning to materials from recycled sources and those made using lowcarbon energy In we continued to improve the carbon efficiency of the integrated circuits we use in our products components weve prioritized because they are carbonintensive For example switching to the Apple M1 chip for the 13inch MacBook Pro reduced the energy needed to manufacture and use the device driving down the products carbon footprint by over percent Weve continued to expand our use of percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of a number of products All iPad models in our lineup now use percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures joining Apple Watch Series Apple Watch SE MacBook Air Mac mini and the 14inch and 16inch MacBook Pro devices For products released in that had enclosures made with primary aluminum we Energy efficiency Were focused on using less energy across our operations beginning with how we design operate and maintain our facilities And we continue these same efforts into our supply chain which benefits the communities where our suppliers operate Drawing less energy from electrical grids many of which still rely heavily on fossil fuels helps reduce local air pollution and improve air quality for nearby communities The emissions from manufacturing our products account for about percent of Apples gross carbon footprint We launched our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program in with the goal of helping suppliers optimize their facilities and operations to use as little energy as possible We provide guidance designed to help suppliers uncover opportunities for energy efficiency Suppliers in our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program avoided more than annualized metric tons of supply chain carbon emissions in fiscal year decrease in emissions across our entire value chain since renewable energy sourced for all Apple facilities suppliers committed to percent renewable electricity for Apple production 47B issued in green bonds to model how businesses can drive investments to reduce global emissions In our latest Green Bond Impact Report we share progress on the projects funded in fiscal year To minimize the carbon footprint of our products we seek to create less waste in the processing of materials reduce machining time and the associated energy used more efficiently transform material into the shapes we need and maximize recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap prioritized the use of aluminum smelted using lowcarbon sources of electricity rather than fossil fuels for a lower carbon impact These changes alone have decreased the carbon emissions associated with our use of aluminum by percent since Product energy use accounts for percent of our gross carbon footprint and has an impact on the individual energy use of each of our customers By addressing this in the earliest phases of design weve cut the product energy use across all major product lines by more than percent since through energy efficiency improvements3 In fiscal year over percent of Apples eligible products by revenue received an ENERGY STAR rating for superior energy efficiency4 And over percent of Apples eligible products by revenue met the requirements for EPEAT registration5

Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Renewable electricity Our retail stores data centers and offices around the world currently source percent renewable electricity Weve focused our efforts to source renewables around several key pillars creating new renewable energy projects undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to local communities and supporting renewable energy innovations About gigawatts of Applecreated renewable electricity projects account for over percent of the renewable electricity our facilities use We continue to experience tremendous progress toward our goal of transitioning our manufacturing supply chain to percent renewable electricity by As of March manufacturing partners in countries have committed to percent renewable energy for Apple production Over percent of companies on Apples Supplier List those suppliers that make up percent of Apples direct spend for materials manufacturing and assembly of our products worldwide have committed to percent renewable electricity In addition many other smaller suppliers have also made these commitments Direct emissions abatement To address the nonelectricity emissions associated with our materials and manufacturing processes we seek technological solutions through emissions abatement or switching to lowcarbon fuel options For example we partnered with aluminum companies and the governments of Canada and Quebec to help fund research and development for ELYSIS a technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from aluminum smelting Many components essential to products like ours including integrated circuit chips and display panels currently rely on manufacturing processes that use fluorinated gases which have high global warming potential Were partnering closely with key manufacturers to prevent these gases from being released into the atmosphere by optimizing manufacturing processes and deploying abatement technologies To address emissions from shipping products to our customers were shifting whenever possible toward less carbonintensive shipping modes such as rail and ocean And were seeking out technical innovations including alternative fuels and electric vehicles In fiscal year Apple avoided metric tons of CO2e by shifting the mode of transport and reducing product weight through the removal of the power adapter from the box of iPhone devices Providing access to clean energy in South Africa Even a few years ago not everyone in one community in South Africa had electricity at home Many people had been using batterypowered lanterns because upfront costs and other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach As we worked with our partners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program we saw exciting potential in this community Our partner on the ground DC GO a solar energy provider based in Johannesburg got to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs Ultimately DC GO developed a payasyougo model that brought solar energy to homes that previously lacked access This was possible only because of the way they built relationships with community members and worked with Apple to price the solution in line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns In addition DC GO hired and trained local people for jobs in sales maintenance and other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project and the communitys access to electricity would be sustainable over time This is just one example of how the Power for Impact program is working to benefit communities our company and the environment at the same time Learn more on pages and of our Environmental Progress Report With access to electricity in their homes

address the emissions we cant yet avoid were are investing in carbon removal projects In addition to removing carbon naturebased carbon removal projects also offer important ecological and social benefits such as preserving biodiversity and enhancing the resilience of ecosystems while often providing economic development opportunities for local communities We partnered with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs to launch the innovative Restore Fund which seeks to blend responsible forestry practices with carbon removal Were working with forestry managers to create sustainably managed forests that optimize for both carbon and wood production creating revenue from timber and generating high quality carbon credits Apple will invest up to million in projects that aim to remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it all while meeting clear social and environmental impact criteria and offering a financial return In its pilot phase the Restore Fund has a goal of removing at least million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year For more information on our efforts to combat climate change and reach our carbon neutral goal read our Environmental Progress Report Climate scenario analysis In we conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical and transition effects of climate change To align with the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures TCFD recommendations we considered a range of future scenarios including a scenario below 2C And we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities The analysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our corporate resiliency It also provided environmental data that we considered in developing business strategies including considerations around supply chain diversification as well as safeguarding our global assets Were committed to managing regulatory reputational and market risks related to climate change For more information on these climaterelated risks and Apples governance of these risks read our CDP submission PDF As the Restore Fund projects come online weve partnered with Conservation International to develop and invest in naturebased carbon removal projects This includes a project to protect and restore acres of mangrove forests in Colombia As the projects in the Restore Fund come online were also working to address difficult toavoid emissions in the short term In fiscal year metric tons of carbon credits were retired from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year And we purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total of metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain a REDD coastal conservation project in Guatemala and a reforestation project in Guizhou Province of China These projects are all certified to the VCS and CCB standards Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Resources Natural resources make our work possible and we take responsibility for how we source use and recycle the materials we rely on to create our products As a starting point this means sourcing responsibly minimizing our freshwater use and eliminating waste across our operations and those of our suppliers And were also seeking to redefine the overall resource footprint of our products Our goal is to one day make products using only responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials Within resources we focus on three main areas of impact Materials Transitioning to only recycled or renewable materials in our products and packaging and maximizing material efficiency product longevity and recovery Water Reducing water impacts in the manufacturing of our products use of our services and operation of our facilities At the same time transitioning to alternative sources improving the quality of water we discharge and protecting shared water resources Zero waste Minimizing overall waste generated and eliminating waste sent to landfill from our manufacturing supply chain as well as corporate offices data centers and retail stores Materials We aim to make the best use of the materials we rely on to make our products Thats why were focusing on three different levers to reduce our footprint and achieve circularity sourcing and efficiency product longevity and product endoflife Sourcing and efficiency Last year we made progress across materials from expanding our use of recycled rare earth elements to designing cameras with recycled gold In September we introduced iPhone with more certified recycled materials than any previous version of iPhone We also introduced percent recycled aluminum enclosures on every single model in the iPad lineup Welcoming the first class of the Impact Accelerator Last year we welcomed the first class to our Impact Accelerator a program for Black HispanicLatinx and Indigenousowned businesses headquartered in the United States that share our focus on innovation and our commitment to the environment Part of Apples Racial Equity and Justice Initiative see page the Accelerator aims to help combat systemic barriers to opportunity while also advancing innovative solutions for communities most impacted by climate change We selected our first class of businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy to begin the program in August The threemonth program included live virtual sessions online courses on supply chain management supplier diversity financial and legal subjects as well as oneonone mentorship with an Apple expert on topics from renewable energy to responsible sourcing The goal of the Impact Accelerator is to better position the participating companies for growth to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts and to expand their customer base all while fostering their environmental commitment For example last October we announced that we will be working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority formed by six Sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources on a project to create a wind power development in the Midwest And following the success of this years class our efforts continue This spring applications opened for the next class to join our Impact Accelerator For Apples inaugural Impact Accelerator leaders from companies participated in a threemonth virtual program with customized training and access to Apple expert mentors In fiscal year nearly percent of the material we shipped in products came from recycled and renewable sources 2x In fiscal year we more than doubled our use of recycled tungsten rare earth elements and cobalt and introduced certified recycled gold for the first time in an Apple product Weve reduced the plastic in our packaging by percent compared with progressing toward our goal to eliminate all plastic from our packaging by Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Across our business we released eight products with more than percent recycled content6 The MacBook Air with M1 chip had the highest total made with percent recycled content devicewide including percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure These and other innovations helped us increase our use of recycled or renewable content to percent of all the material shipped in products in fiscal year Product longevity We want to make the most of the materials we use through designing longlasting products We are designing durable hardware leveraging software updates to extend functionality expanding access to repair services refurbishing devices for their next user and reusing parts that still have more to give Read more on caring for customers on page Product endoflife By effectively recovering the materials in our products we enable the circular supply chains that make the best use of finite resources Through our work in this area were reducing the need to mine new materials and the amount of energy needed to manufacture new products ultimately driving down emissions and conserving resources In percent of the countries where we sell products we continue to provide and participate in product takeback and recycling collection programs With the help of customer and employee participation across recycling programs we directed more than metric tons of ewaste to recycling globally in fiscal year Weve also continued to innovate on disassembly technologies Daisy the robot we designed to disassemble iPhone devices has now been joined by Dave which dismantles Taptic Engines from iPhone to enable the recovery of materials like rare earth elements tungsten and steel and Taz designed to recycle modules containing rare earth magnets At our Material Recovery Lab were working on developing better more efficient means of disassembling products that maximize material recovery while minimizing waste Water stewardship Were committed to managing the resources we share with the communities where we and our suppliers operate Our efforts to address the water footprint of our corporate sites and of our suppliers sites focus on Using water efficiently Expanding the use of alternative water sources including onsite reuse Discharging water responsibly Enhancing our water stewardship to keep watersheds healthy for all who rely on them In fiscal year our facilities used about billion gallons of water We saved million gallons of freshwater this fiscal year due to efficiency projects implemented since Last year alternative water sources accounted for percent of our total corporate water usage primarily from recycled water sources10 Our supply chain accounts for percent of our total water footprint based on our detailed water inventory Thats why we partner closely with our suppliers through our Clean Water Program The more than participating supplier sites increased their average reuse rate to percent and saved our suppliers billion gallons of freshwater in fiscal year for a total of billion gallons of water savings since the programs launch in Innovating packaging to reduce our footprint Weve made significant progress toward eliminating all plastics from our packaging by This past year plastics accounted for only percent of our packaging Since weve dedicated our efforts to replacing large plastic trays wraps and foam cushioning with fiber alternatives that have higher recovery rates and reduced environmental footprints This year the iPhone and iPhone Pro were the first iPhone models to be shipped without any plastic packaging components8 And we replaced plastic foam with a fiber alternative to protect the 24inch iMac during shipping For the 24inch iMac using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorption allowed us to reduce plastic by percent Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Smarter chemistry The wellbeing of our employees customers people in our supply chain and the planet is a priority for Apple which is why were committed to using safer materials to create safer products This commitment requires diligent work to build a comprehensive picture of chemicals across our supply chain to insist on rigorous chemical management processes to promote adoption of safer chemical alternatives and to innovate through design smarter approaches to making our products Using safer chemistry in our products also enables recycling and material recovery so that our products can be the raw materials for the next generation The pillars of our smarter chemistry strategy are Mapping and engagement Engage our supply chain partners to comprehensively identify the chemicals in the materials used to make our products allowing us to drive change that goes beyond what is required for regulatory compliance Assessment and management Assess the potential human health and environmental risks of chemicals to evaluate compliance with our requirements and inform product design Innovation Drive the development and use of innovative materials that enable the creation of groundbreaking products and also support industrywide change Mapping and engagement Our Full Material Disclosure FMD program maps the chemicals used in our products an effort that includes tens of thousands of parts and assemblies Then we look at how our products are manufactured Our Chemical Safety Disclosure CSD program engages with supply chain partners to get the most recent information on which materials are in use This information includes the volume of materials being consumed and how theyre being applied stored and handled as well as the steps being taken to protect employees More than supplier facilities have shared their chemical inventories as well as storage and safety protocols as part of our CSD program Through this process weve identified more than chemicals and applications These efforts contribute to a safer work environment for people across our supply chain Zero waste Across our corporate operations were reducing the amount of waste we generate and directing more toward recycling programs In fiscal year recycling and composting efforts allowed us to achieve a waste diversion rate of percent limiting landfill waste from our global operations to about metric tons12 Our overall waste generated also remained low in part due to COVIDrelated temporary closure of facilities Last year our Mesa Arizona data center became the second Apple facility to receive TRUE certification for zero waste following the Prineville data center in Apple works with the Alliance for Water Stewardship and others to promote water stewardship that protects the health of water basins including the Kunshan watershed in China Apple supplier facilities are zero waste verified 2M metric tons of waste redirected from landfill by supplier facilities as part of Apples Zero Waste Program Read more about our efforts to conserve resources in our Environmental Progress Report Weve partnered with our suppliers recyclers and waste solution providers to eliminate waste from our manufacturing processes At the close of fiscal year more than facilities had been zero waste verified nearly half of the supplier facilities that are part of our Zero Waste Program14 All participating facilities across countries can access resources including guidance on how to reduce waste and then reuse recycle or compost the waste they do create And were seeing results In fiscal year suppliers redirected metric tons of waste from landfills bringing the total to over million metric tons since the programs inception the equivalent of eliminating more than million square meters of landfill space Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Assessment and management The data we collect on chemicals and materials forms the foundation for key decisions that have an impact on our product designs manufacturing processes and approach to recycling and reuse This data enables us to establish requirements for our suppliers including those set out in our Regulated Substances Specification RSS and the Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials list These requirements provide clear guidelines on potentially harmful materials including those that are restricted Our assessment system helps to ensure that only materials that meet our stringent requirements are used in Apple products At our Environmental Testing Lab we evaluate the safety of our products and materials through chemical analyses Our chemists test materials for safety and monitor compliance with our specifications In fiscal year we performed toxicological assessments on new materials to proactively evaluate and eliminate potentially harmful substances from our products Both the data we gather on chemicals and our rigorous assessments allow us to make informed decisions and manage chemicals for the safety of those who use make and recycle our products Innovation The work we do in mapping assessing and managing the chemicals within our supply chain underpins our innovations We rely on detailed information on the material properties

IDPR contains a set of new requirements resulting from our learnings during the pandemic which will help our suppliers better prepare for and be ready to respond to an infectious disease outbreak at their facility As part of the rollout of IDPR in fiscal year we conducted more than onsite and remote specialized assessments to verify suppliers compliance with COVID19 control protocols in order to drive improvement when necessary We also continue to assess any existing gaps at supplier facilities and identify opportunities to work with those in higherrisk areas to help make their facilities safer This includes working with thirdparty suppliers to redesign and reconfigure factory floor plans where necessary implementing flexible working hours to maximize interpersonal space implementing enhanced deep cleaning protocols and deploying masks and sanitizers In fiscal year we also encouraged our suppliers employees to get vaccinated and boosted where available We also partnered with NGOs to help further support supplier employees as well as those working deeper in our supply chain particularly those from vulnerable groups We worked with the International Organization for Migration IOM the worlds leading organization providing services to migrant workers to provide support to migrant workers impacted by the pandemic With support from Apple our longtime partner Pact an international development organization prepared and coordinated activities to prevent the spread of COVID19 in several mining communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC The initiative has reached more than people through individual and group dialogues on COVID19 prevention since the program began in December Giving back to our communities Apples companywide response to the COVID19 pandemic involved teams across the business including product design engineering operations packaging teams suppliers and more At the beginning of the pandemic when personal protective equipment was in short supply we sourced through our supply chain and donated more than million masks for healthcare workers worldwide We also launched a companywide effort to produce and ship over million face shields These face shields were delivered to sites around the world from New York Presbyterian Hospital in the US to the Ministry of Health in Zambia Additionally we have also donated over million to the World Health

hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when theyre conducting business for Apple We abide by EHS requirements in every country where we operate and are dedicated to doing everything we can to support the safety and wellbeing of our global teams Managing workrelated hazards and risks To help ensure the safety of our workers and customers we put procedures in place to identify workplace risks and mitigate possible hazards We support and protect employees in lower hazard spaces and we put risk specific programs in place for those working in higher hazard environments including safe systems of work chemical management laser safety equipment and machinery safety hazardous materials management and electrical safety Employees can request to have their workspaces individually inspected to review hazards and controls including ergonomics evaluations Apple implements a hierarchy of control for significant risks which centers on elimination substitution engineering controls administrative controls and personal protective equipment PPE As one example Apple EHS regularly assesses hazards at our research labs based on their chemical equipment laser and other hazards Approximately percent of our labs are considered complex meaning that they contain highhazard processes and equipment These assessments help teams understand which EHS programs and controls must be put in place to mitigate risks In Apple completed hazard assessments in over research labs globally Our EHS teams identify and provide team members with appropriate PPE for specific hazards This PPE is provided at no cost and with training on correct use For example our hearing conservation programs include evaluation and control of occupational exposures to noise and hearing protection is available for processes areas and tasks with potential high noise exposures Additionally EHS conducts mandatory health checks for employees where theyre needed We invest in new technologies as we continue to manage potential risks across our operations including our Appleowned manufacturing sites Our standards programs trainings procedures and other safeguards are managed by trained EHS professionals and where required we also translate EHS procedures into local languages for our team members Risks identified from incidents injuries and nonroutine events are addressed expeditiously to identify and implement appropriate corrective and preventative actions and we integrate our learnings into future program development and training Lessons learned are

Assessments also known as audits are one of several methods we use to measure compliance with our requirements These independent thirdparty assessments which take place onsite at supplier facilities provide a snapshot of a suppliers performance However when combined with regular engagement with supplier teams mandated reporting and listening directly to hundreds of thousands of supplier employees about their workplace experiences our rigorous supplier assessments provide a clear measure of their performance in upholding our Code and Standards In the reporting period assessments were conducted

Our goal is to work together with suppliers to help them improve their management systems rather than to simply remove them from our supply chain without helping them correct the issues we have discovered In the event that a supplier is unwilling or unable to improve their operations to meet our requirements they risk removal from our supply chain Since we have directed the removal of manufacturing supplier facilities and smelters and refiners from our supply chain for being unwilling or unable to sufficiently improve their operations to meet our requirements Results of our assessments are detailed in our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report beginning on page A responsibility that grows with our business As Apples business continues to grow and expand to new areas we adapt our supplier engagement model accordingly This includes continuing to expand our scope to conduct independent thirdparty assessments of a growing number of suppliers that support our business outside of manufacturing Last year we increased our engagement and expanded the application of our Code and Standards to suppliers supporting newer areas of Apples business including those that work with our content services like Apple TV and Apple Fitness Supplier employees at Final Assembly in the US How we stay engaged with suppliers widely used by the industry A total of RBA VAP assessments were completed in fiscal year at Apple supplier sites If we uncover noncompliance in the course of any assessment or engagement we take prompt action so that suppliers not only correct and remedy the issue but make meaningful longterm changes to their systems and processes We do this through a Corrective Action Plan CAP during which and 90day checkins with Apple are required We then conduct our Corrective Action Verification CAV process to verify that all corrective actions have been successfully implemented and necessary steps have Code of conduct assessments Specialized assessments Investigations Capability building Ongoing training Early engagement These assessments also include unannounced assessments and unannounced visits in response to workers grievances and allegations or to verify risks at supplier facilities based on predictive analytics In fiscal year unannounced assessments and investigations were conducted where the supplier facility was provided no

immediately investigate and to resolve the issue in a timely manner In we launched a grievance hotline awareness campaign and its initial rollout resulted in a percent increase in utilization of these thirdparty hotlines The reports we received from supplier employees via hotlines in included issues related to wages and benefits employee relations amenities at supplier facilities workforce stability and health and safety In each case we investigated and worked directly with the suppliers to drive improvement and correct any compliance issues found Suppliers implemented a number of actions as a result of supplier employee feedback through these Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report channels including improvements to working hours resignation processes timing of bonuses and the use of personal protective equipment PPE Workplace satisfaction In addition to interviews and grievance channels we also engage with supplier employees to understand their overall workplace satisfaction In we anonymously surveyed supplier employees in facilities across Greater China India Ireland Malaysia Philippines Singapore UK US and Vietnam about their workplace experiences nearly double the number of supplier employees surveyed last fiscal year As a result suppliers took actions including better commute options increasing wages and bonuses offering better food variety and skill development opportunities for entrylevel managers Responsible labor recruitment Our Code and Standards and the protections they provide apply equally to all workers regardless of a persons job geographic location or how they enter our supply chain and this commitment begins even before a worker ever enters our supply chain This includes zero tolerance for forced labor We implement strict policies and procedures with our suppliers to protect workers in our supply chain from forced labor This includes selecting suppliers for assessments based on factors such as their geographic location which may put them at higher risk of forced labor violations as well as their previous performance andor history of violations or allegations Suppliers may also receive additional specialized assessments based on the nature of their business or employee population such as those that employ Foreign Contract Workers and those located in higher risk migration corridors Our Code and Standards also require that all supplier employees have an effective mechanism to report grievances In addition we provide thirdparty anonymous hotlines and the ability to contact the Apple Environment and Supply Chain Innovation ESCI team directly at any time and in any language When an issue is raised supplier management is required to promptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a timely manner We strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor throughout our worldwide supply chain and look for evidence of it in every supplier assessment we conduct including unannounced assessments Last year we conducted more than assessments and found no instances where anyone was forced to work in our supply chain We did discover two cases in Taiwan in which people paid recruitment fees to secure their job which is a violation of our Code We required the supplier to directly repay their employees in full and verified repayment through a thirdparty auditor The payment of recruitment fees withholding an employees passport or personal identity documents or restricting an employees freedom of movement are Core Violations of our Code and Standards the most serious level of Code violations If we discover workers have paid recruitment fees at any point on their employment journey to an Apple supplier we require supplier management to take prompt action to provide remedy to those affected by directly repaying their workers for any and all fees even if the supplier was unaware that their employees had paid recruitment fees From through fiscal year our suppliers have repaid million in recruitment fees directly to workers Finally in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration IOM and the Responsible Business Alliance RBA we expanded our Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit to more than additional supplier facilities in countries reaching nearly workers globally with percent of those working on Apple production lines 236M supplier employees trained on their rights since supplier employees directly engaged about their workplace experiences through interviews and satisfaction surveys supplier employees reached by grievance hotline awareness campaign Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report How we work to prevent forced labor in our supply chain Apple has zero tolerance for forced labor In the more than countries and regions where our suppliers operate we have teams of experts including independent third parties who monitor our suppliers and put in place industryleading procedures to help ensure that no one is forced to work Our comprehensive policies start before we even sign a contract with suppliers and we are consistently raising the bar We set the highest standards Eliminating forced labor begins with setting and maintaining the highest standards Our standards often go above and beyond legal requirements to protect people from forced labor risks We engage early To address forced labor risks at its roots we know that our work has to begin before people enter our supply chain We hold suppliers accountable Once weve implemented thorough preventative measures independent thirdparty assessments verify that our suppliers are meeting our standards Looking for evidence of forced labor is part of every supplier assessment If we find any violations of our Code and Standards we take swift action to remedy the issue and improve their operations We track progress and report transparently Consistent improvement requires transparency and accountability Since we have been publishing reports on our efforts across all of our work to transparently share our progress and challenges We regularly engage and partner with stakeholders Engagement with stakeholders and rights holders is critical to accountability ensuring were taking action where its needed and to achieving rapid progress Aligning with international frameworks Apple policies and our supplier requirements align with international labor and human rights standards including those of the International Labour Organization the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights UNGPs and the Organisation for Economic CoOperation and Development The Apple Human Rights Policy Our Human Rights Policy outlines how we treat everyone including our customers employees business partners and the people across every level of our supply chain Read the Apple Human Rights Policy The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards Our supplier requirements contain strict standards for responsible labor recruitment and apply to all suppliers protecting workers globally We go above and beyond legal requirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor recruitment in regions where we cannot conduct adequate due diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy because we believe no one should pay to secure a job Read the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards Thorough mapping informs our strategy An effective strategy requires deep understanding of our supply chain To date we have mapped over labor recruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across countries A leading strategy requires leading tools The Apple Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit developed in partnership with the International Organization for Migration provides suppliers and their labor agencies with easytouse tools that help them effectively manage and report data mitigating forced labor risks before people even enter our supply chain In addition to providing handson training we are making these tools openly available for others to use Awareness is power We require our suppliers to provide their employees with training on their workplace rights on their first day on the job This helps to ensure that every person is aware of their rights and what to do if theyre not being respected which includes the ability to anonymously contact Apple directly Foreign Contract Workers who make up a very small percentage of people in our supply chain also receive training prior to leaving their home country as well as upon arriving in their destination country To date our suppliers have provided workplace rights training to over million people In addition last year we directly engaged with over people in our supply chain to learn more about their workplace experience Investing in consistent improvement Through our new Supplier Employee Development Fund were investing 50M to expand programs designed to continue to improve the rights training experience worker voice platforms and supplier employee education opportunities A close look We regularly conduct independent thirdparty assessments including surprise assessments of our suppliers verifying compliance with over points across our standards This includes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring and personnel records are in place and accurate In addition to specialized forced labor assessments for atrisk suppliers we also require many suppliers to participate in facilitywide assessments such as the Validated Assessment Program to verify performance across the suppliers entire business In the event that we find gaps in a suppliers compliance or capabilities we require them to implement a Corrective Action Plan To date our assessments have covered percent of our direct manufacturing spend We investigate every report In addition to thoroughly assessing our suppliers performance in upholding our standards we also receive reports from the press governments civil society and people in our supply chain and we encourage the public to report concerns via httpswwwapplecomuksupplierresponsibility We investigate every report and frequently have Apple teams onsite within hours Swift action and steep penalties Forced labor in any form is a Core Violation the most serious violation level of our requirements If a Core Violation is discovered the suppliers CEO is notified and the supplier is immediately placed on probation pending the successful completion of a Corrective Action Plan Probation can include no new projects no new business and termination of existing business In addition to commercial penalties if a supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our standards they risk removal from our supply chain Since we have directed the removal of manufacturing supplier facilities and smelters and refiners for failure to meet our requirements Action this year In FY21 across more than assessments we found no instances where anyone was forced to work in our supply chain We did find two cases where employees of the same supplier in Taiwan paid recruitment fees Per our requirements the supplier directly repaid their employees for those fees To date our suppliers have directly repaid 332M in recruitment fees to of their employees People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Annual Progress Report Published annually since formerly known as the Supplier Responsibility Progress Report this

associated with renewable energy amounted to about metric tons CO2e We have not accounted for emissions resulting from employees working from home because we anticipated these emissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving our methodology We regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability standards So in fiscal year we changed how we calculate emissions from business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air travel As a result of this change our scope transportation emissions increased by percent between and Without the methodology change these emissions would have increased by percent which reflects the growth in our business Beginning in fiscal year we updated our methodology to reflect the impact of COVID19 on employee commute We retired metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards Because were committed to accuracy and transparency we regularly refine our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data For example we recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our products are sold and used resulting in more granularity possible for grid emission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase The net result was an increase in our carbon footprint When using the same level of data granularity and model as our product use carbon emissions in would have been about percent lower For fiscal year we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya and purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total of metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain The first project a REDD coastal conservation project in Guatemala protects and conserves forests from deforestation and degradation The second project aims to establish forests on about

certified and supplier reported The actual total recycled content may be higher given industry average recycled content not included here Total recycled material shipped in products is driven by product material composition and total sales and may fluctuate based on the number and type of products sold each year Plastic packaging components refer to any packaging part made of majority plastic including plastic wraps plastic trays or plastic screen films Some plastic is still found on packaging components made primarily of fiber These savings do not include reduction in water use from facility closures and reduced occupancy due to the COVID19 pandemic We consider those savings temporary and also acknowledge that the water use was transferred to employees homes This total includes freshwater use as well as alternative water sources including recycled water rainwater and recovered condensate We define freshwater as drinkingwater quality the majority of which comes from municipal sources and less than percent comes from onsite groundwater sources Recycled water represents a key alternative water source Our recycled water is sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants with less than percent from onsite treatment Recycled water is primarily used for irrigation makeup water in cooling or toilet flushing Other alternative sources of freshwater include rainwater and recovered condensate that is captured onsite Water used for construction for activities like dust control is not included in this total and represents million gallons of water used in fiscal year Our actual water discharge may vary by percent relative to our estimates In these estimates weve taken into account consumptive activities including irrigation and cooling towers We are now accounting for savings through this program on a fiscal year basis rather than a calendar year basis as was reported in previous years Waste diversion rates do not include construction and demolition waste or electronic waste for fiscal year Electronic waste is accounted for in the total metric tons of electronic waste we sent to recycling found on page of the Environmental Progress Report Our Mesa and

take strong decisive and inclusive steps to mitigate our climate impact Weve committed to achieving carbon neutrality reducing emissions percent compared with fiscal year and balancing the residual emissions with carbon removal across the life cycle of all of our products by And the Science Based Targets initiative SBTi has validated an emissions reduction target for Apple derived from this goal2 Its an ambitious plan with plenty of challenges ahead But were already well on our way having cut carbon emissions across our value chain by percent since fiscal year Our work began years ago making the transition to sourcing percent renewable electricity at our offices retail stores and data centers At Apple were acting with urgency to protect our planets limited resources and to be a leader in the fight against climate change Since weve been carbon neutral for our worldwide operations and by we plan to expand that progress to our entire supply chain and the lifetime use of our products And today nearly percent of the materials in our products were made from recycled content a number were working to increase Across our environmental work were also committed to being a force for equity Were working with communities on the frontlines of climate change and the next generation of diverse entrepreneurs to create shared opportunity and to build a more just world Our approach The environmental challenges we face today are significant and were responding with urgency and dedication We approach our work by focusing on fundamental questions What matters most And where can we make the greatest impact These questions guide our work across our strategic focus areas of climate change resources and smarter chemistry and inform our goals in how we can best achieve change We know were not alone in working to reduce our environmental footprint So were engaging with others to support our efforts and find opportunities to lift local communities along the way Setting ambitious goals is essential to our approach to drive the innovation and collaboration that makes change possible and to be transparent and accountable to our progress Our work is led by Lisa Jackson Apples Vice President of Environment Policy and Social Initiatives reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook The Environment Policy and Social Initiatives team works with other teams across Apple to set strategy engage stakeholders and communicate progress Our integrated approach means that decisions about the environment are reviewed and supported at the highest levels of the company Our Environmental Progress Report provides a detailed overview of our work and how were progressing toward our goals which we achieved in And in we reached the milestone of being carbon neutral for our corporate operations including direct emissions as well as business travel and employee commute Our 10year Climate Roadmap is addressing Apples carbon footprint through five pillars Lowcarbon design We will design products and manufacturing processes to be less carbonintensive through thoughtful material selection increased material efficiency and greater product energy efficiency Energy efficiency We will increase energy efficiency at our facilities and in our supply chain by finding opportunities such as retrofitting to reduce energy use Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Renewable electricity We will continue to source percent renewable electricity for our facilities and transition our entire supply chain to percent clean renewable sources of electricity Direct emissions abatement We will reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions in our facilities and our supply chain through process innovation emissions abatement and the use of nonfossilbased lowcarbon fuels Carbon removal Working in parallel with our emissions reduction efforts we will scale up investments in carbon removal projects including naturebased solutions that protect and restore ecosystems around the world Lowcarbon design To reduce the carbon footprint of our products were increasing efficiency and transitioning to materials from recycled sources and those made using lowcarbon energy In we continued to improve the carbon efficiency of the integrated circuits we use in our products components weve prioritized because they are carbonintensive For example switching to the Apple M1 chip for the 13inch MacBook Pro reduced the energy needed to manufacture and use the device driving down the products carbon footprint by over percent Weve continued to expand our use of percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of a number of products All iPad models in our lineup now use percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures joining Apple Watch Series Apple Watch SE MacBook Air Mac mini and the 14inch and 16inch MacBook Pro devices For products released in that had enclosures made with primary aluminum we Energy efficiency Were focused on using less energy across our operations beginning with how we design operate and maintain our facilities And we continue these same efforts into our supply chain which benefits the communities where our suppliers operate Drawing less energy from electrical grids many of which still rely heavily on fossil fuels helps reduce local air pollution and improve air quality for nearby communities The emissions from manufacturing our products account for about percent of Apples gross carbon footprint We launched our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program in with the goal of helping suppliers optimize their facilities and operations to use as little energy as possible We provide guidance designed to help suppliers uncover opportunities for energy efficiency Suppliers in our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program avoided more than annualized metric tons of supply chain carbon emissions in fiscal year decrease in emissions across our entire value chain since renewable energy sourced for all Apple facilities suppliers committed to percent renewable electricity for Apple production 47B issued in green bonds to model how businesses can drive investments to reduce global emissions In our latest Green Bond Impact Report we share progress on the projects funded in fiscal year To minimize the carbon footprint of our products we seek to create less waste in the processing of materials reduce machining time and the associated energy used more efficiently transform material into the shapes we need and maximize recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap prioritized the use of aluminum smelted using lowcarbon sources of electricity rather than fossil fuels for a lower carbon impact These changes alone have decreased the carbon emissions associated with our use of aluminum by percent since Product energy use accounts for percent of our gross carbon footprint and has an impact on the individual energy use of each of our customers By addressing this in the earliest phases of design weve cut the product energy use across all major product lines by more than percent since through energy efficiency improvements3 In fiscal year over percent of Apples eligible products by revenue received an ENERGY STAR rating for superior energy efficiency4 And over percent of Apples eligible products by revenue met the requirements for EPEAT registration5

This past year we intensified our efforts to reduce Apples emissions In fiscal year we avoided over million metric tons of emissions across all scopes Initiatives that weve been growing for years like sourcing percent renewable electricity for our facilities transitioning suppliers to clean energy and using lowcarbon materials in products yielded indisputable results Thanks to this work weve begun to decouple business growth from emissions While our revenue grew percent our emissions grew by less than percent To mitigate this increase in emissions we applied an additional million tons of renewable energy credits RECs and million metric tons of carbon offsets to proportionally cover electricity use and direct emissions respectively across our value chain This represents a shortterm bridging solution as we grow our carbon reduction programs to meet the scale of the challenge Lowcarbon materials represents emissions savings from transitioning to recycled materials in our products or use of lowcarbon aluminum as described on page Net carbon emissions represents our total gross footprint minus carbon offsets applied to each category Percentages shown for each emissions category

Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Renewable electricity Our retail stores data centers and offices around the world currently source percent renewable electricity Weve focused our efforts to source renewables around several key pillars creating new renewable energy projects undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to local communities and supporting renewable energy innovations About gigawatts of Applecreated renewable electricity projects account for over percent of the renewable electricity our facilities use We continue to experience tremendous progress toward our goal of transitioning our manufacturing supply chain to percent renewable electricity by As of March manufacturing partners in countries have committed to percent renewable energy for Apple production Over percent of companies on Apples Supplier List those suppliers that make up percent of Apples direct spend for materials manufacturing and assembly of our products worldwide have committed to percent renewable electricity In addition many other smaller suppliers have also made these commitments Direct emissions abatement To address the nonelectricity emissions associated with our materials and manufacturing processes we seek technological solutions through emissions abatement or switching to lowcarbon fuel options For example we partnered with aluminum companies and the governments of Canada and Quebec to help fund research and development for ELYSIS a technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from aluminum smelting Many components essential to products like ours including integrated circuit chips and display panels currently rely on manufacturing processes that use fluorinated gases which have high global warming potential Were partnering closely with key manufacturers to prevent these gases from being released into the atmosphere by optimizing manufacturing processes and deploying abatement technologies To address emissions from shipping products to our customers were shifting whenever possible toward less carbonintensive shipping modes such as rail and ocean And were seeking out technical innovations including alternative fuels and electric vehicles In fiscal year Apple avoided metric tons of CO2e by shifting the mode of transport and reducing product weight through the removal of the power adapter from the box of iPhone devices Providing access to clean energy in South Africa Even a few years ago not everyone in one community in South Africa had electricity at home Many people had been using batterypowered lanterns because upfront costs and other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach As we worked with our partners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program we saw exciting potential in this community Our partner on the ground DC GO a solar energy provider based in Johannesburg got to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs Ultimately DC GO developed a payasyougo model that brought solar energy to homes that previously lacked access This was possible only because of the way they built relationships with community members and worked with Apple to price the solution in line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns In addition DC GO hired and trained local people for jobs in sales maintenance and other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project and the communitys access to electricity would be sustainable over time This is just one example of how the Power for Impact program is working to benefit communities our company and the environment at the same time Learn more on pages and of our Environmental Progress Report With access to electricity in their homes

address the emissions we cant yet avoid were are investing in carbon removal projects In addition to removing carbon naturebased carbon removal projects also offer important ecological and social benefits such as preserving biodiversity and enhancing the resilience of ecosystems while often providing economic development opportunities for local communities We partnered with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs to launch the innovative Restore Fund which seeks to blend responsible forestry practices with carbon removal Were working with forestry managers to create sustainably managed forests that optimize for both carbon and wood production creating revenue from timber and generating high quality carbon credits Apple will invest up to million in projects that aim to remove

Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Resources Natural resources make our work possible and we take responsibility for how we source use and recycle the materials we rely on to create our products As a starting point this means sourcing responsibly minimizing our freshwater use and eliminating waste across our operations and those of our suppliers And were also seeking to redefine the overall resource footprint of our products Our goal is to one day make products using only responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials Within resources we focus on three main areas of impact Materials Transitioning to only recycled or renewable materials in our products and packaging and maximizing material efficiency product longevity and recovery Water Reducing water impacts in the manufacturing of our products use of our services and operation of our facilities At the same time transitioning to alternative sources improving the quality of water we discharge and protecting shared water resources Zero waste Minimizing overall waste generated and eliminating waste sent to landfill from our manufacturing supply chain as well as corporate offices data centers and retail stores Materials We aim to make the best use of the materials we rely on to make our products Thats why were focusing on three different levers to reduce our footprint and achieve circularity sourcing and efficiency product longevity and product endoflife Sourcing and efficiency Last year we made progress across materials from expanding our use of recycled rare earth elements to designing cameras with recycled gold In September we introduced iPhone with more certified recycled materials than any previous version of iPhone We also introduced percent recycled aluminum enclosures on every single model in the iPad lineup Welcoming the first class of the Impact Accelerator Last year we welcomed the first class to our Impact Accelerator a program for Black HispanicLatinx and Indigenousowned businesses headquartered in the United States that share our focus on innovation and our commitment to the environment Part of Apples Racial Equity and Justice Initiative see page the Accelerator aims to help combat systemic barriers to opportunity while also advancing innovative solutions for communities most impacted by climate change We selected our first class of businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy to begin the program in August The threemonth program included live virtual sessions online courses on supply chain management supplier diversity financial and legal subjects as well as oneonone mentorship with an Apple expert on topics from renewable energy to responsible sourcing The goal of the Impact Accelerator is to better position the participating companies for growth to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts and to expand their customer base all while fostering their environmental commitment For example last October we announced that we will be working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority formed by six Sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources on a project to create a wind power development in the Midwest And following the success of this years class our efforts continue This spring applications opened for the next class to join our Impact Accelerator For Apples inaugural Impact Accelerator leaders from companies participated in a threemonth virtual program with customized training and access to Apple expert mentors In fiscal year nearly percent of the material we shipped in products came from recycled and renewable sources 2x In fiscal year we more than doubled our use of recycled tungsten rare earth elements and cobalt and introduced certified recycled gold for the first time in an Apple product Weve reduced the plastic in our packaging by percent compared with progressing toward our goal to eliminate all plastic from our packaging by Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Across our business we released eight products with more than percent recycled content6 The MacBook Air with M1 chip had the highest total made with percent recycled content devicewide including percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure These and other innovations helped us increase our use of recycled or renewable content to percent of all the material shipped in products in fiscal year Product longevity We want to make the most of the materials we use through designing longlasting products We are designing durable hardware leveraging software updates to extend functionality expanding access to repair services refurbishing devices for their next user and reusing parts that still have more to give Read more on caring for customers on page Product endoflife By effectively recovering the materials in our products we enable the circular supply chains that make the best use of finite resources Through our work in this area were reducing the need to mine new materials and the amount of energy needed to manufacture new products ultimately driving down emissions and conserving resources In percent of the countries where we sell products we continue to provide and participate in product takeback and recycling collection programs With the help of customer and employee participation across recycling programs we directed more than metric tons of ewaste to recycling globally in fiscal year Weve also continued to innovate on disassembly technologies Daisy the robot we designed to disassemble iPhone devices has now been joined by Dave which dismantles Taptic Engines from iPhone to enable the recovery of materials like rare earth elements tungsten and steel and Taz designed to recycle modules containing rare earth magnets At our Material Recovery Lab were working on developing better more efficient means of disassembling products that maximize material recovery while minimizing waste Water stewardship Were committed to managing the resources we share with the communities where we and our suppliers operate Our efforts to address the water footprint of our corporate sites and of our suppliers sites focus on Using water efficiently Expanding the use of alternative water sources including onsite reuse Discharging water responsibly Enhancing our water stewardship to keep watersheds healthy for all who rely on them In fiscal year our facilities used about billion gallons of water We saved million gallons of freshwater this fiscal year due to efficiency projects implemented since Last year alternative water sources accounted for percent of our total corporate water usage primarily from recycled water sources10 Our supply chain accounts for percent of our total water footprint based on our detailed water inventory Thats why we partner closely with our suppliers through our Clean Water Program The more than participating supplier sites increased their average reuse rate to percent and saved our suppliers billion gallons of freshwater in fiscal year for a total of billion gallons of water savings since the programs launch in Innovating packaging to reduce our footprint Weve made significant progress toward eliminating all plastics from our packaging by This past year plastics accounted for only percent of our packaging Since weve dedicated our efforts to replacing large plastic trays wraps and foam cushioning with fiber alternatives that have higher recovery rates and reduced environmental footprints This year the iPhone and iPhone Pro were the first iPhone models to be shipped without any plastic packaging components8 And we replaced plastic foam with a fiber alternative to protect the 24inch iMac during shipping For the 24inch iMac using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorption allowed us to reduce plastic by percent Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Smarter chemistry The wellbeing of our employees customers people in our supply chain and the planet is a priority for Apple which is why were committed to using safer materials to create safer products This commitment requires diligent work to build a comprehensive picture of chemicals across our supply chain to insist on rigorous chemical management processes to promote adoption of safer chemical alternatives and to innovate through design smarter approaches to making our products Using safer chemistry in our products also enables recycling and material recovery so that our products can be the raw materials for the next generation The pillars of our smarter chemistry strategy are Mapping and engagement Engage our supply chain partners to comprehensively identify the chemicals in the materials used to make our products allowing us to drive change that goes beyond what is required for regulatory compliance Assessment and management Assess the potential human health and environmental risks of chemicals to evaluate compliance with our requirements and inform product design Innovation Drive the development and use of innovative materials that enable the creation of groundbreaking products and also support industrywide change Mapping and engagement Our Full Material Disclosure FMD program maps the chemicals used in our products an effort that includes tens of thousands of parts and assemblies Then we look at how our products are manufactured Our Chemical Safety Disclosure CSD program engages with supply chain partners to get the most recent information on which materials are in use This information includes the volume of materials being consumed and how theyre being applied stored and handled as well as the steps being taken to protect employees More than supplier facilities have shared their chemical inventories as well as storage and safety protocols as part of our CSD program Through this process weve identified more than chemicals and applications These efforts contribute to a safer work environment for people across our supply chain Zero waste Across our corporate operations were reducing the amount of waste we generate and directing more toward recycling programs In fiscal year recycling and composting efforts allowed us to achieve a waste diversion rate of percent limiting landfill waste from our global operations to about metric tons12 Our overall waste generated also remained low in part due to COVIDrelated temporary closure of facilities Last year our Mesa Arizona data center became the second Apple facility to receive TRUE certification for zero waste following the Prineville data center in Apple works with the Alliance for Water Stewardship and others to promote water stewardship that protects the health of water basins including the Kunshan watershed in China Apple supplier facilities are zero waste verified 2M metric tons of waste redirected from landfill by supplier facilities as part of Apples Zero Waste Program Read more about our efforts to conserve resources in our Environmental Progress Report Weve partnered with

the supplier facilities that are part of our Zero Waste Program14 All participating facilities across countries can access resources including guidance on how to reduce waste and then reuse recycle or compost the waste they do create And were seeing results In fiscal year suppliers redirected metric tons of waste from landfills bringing the total to over million metric tons since the programs inception the equivalent of eliminating more than million square meters of landfill space Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Assessment and management The data we collect on chemicals and materials forms the foundation for key decisions that have an impact on our product designs manufacturing processes and approach to recycling and reuse This data enables us to establish requirements for our suppliers including those set out in our Regulated Substances Specification RSS and the Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials list These requirements provide clear guidelines on potentially harmful materials including those that are restricted Our assessment system helps to ensure that only materials that meet our stringent requirements are used in Apple products At our Environmental Testing Lab we evaluate the safety of our products and materials through chemical analyses Our chemists test materials for safety and monitor compliance with our specifications In fiscal year we performed toxicological assessments on new materials to proactively evaluate and eliminate potentially harmful substances from our products Both the data we gather on chemicals and our rigorous assessments allow us to make informed decisions and manage chemicals for the safety of those who use make and recycle our products Innovation The work we do in mapping assessing and managing the chemicals within our supply chain underpins our innovations We rely on detailed information on the material properties including toxicological data and environmental performance characteristics We also look Comprehensive chemical mapping Understanding chemical ingredients leads to better materials for Apple products Through our Full Material Disclosure FMD program manufacturers share chemical ingredients used to make materials with Apple With FMD data Apple evaluates the chemicals in materials against

business we have a strong record of hiring temporary workers as full and parttime employees Our outsourced services with workers provided via vendors generally perform work that can be different from that performed by our permanent employees This workforce is intended to support business needs where specific skills are required and the vendors have the ability to scale with our varied business needs Pay and benefits For vendor services pay rates are managed by the vendor Various benefits including but not limited to healthcare are offered to these workers through their employer or staffing agencies Vendors are also accountable to Apples Supplier Code of Conduct which requires that our staffing agencies are compliant with all current local and national legislation and employment laws

Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Protecting each others health At every stage of the pandemic our first priority has always been the health of our teams customers and communities That meant being one of the first companies to close our offices and retail stores and finding innovative ways to connect with colleagues and customers virtually Since weve continued our efforts and programs to support our people We adopted CDC recommendations around uptodate vaccinations including booster doses Apple also continued to pay our teams during temporary store and office closures expanded our paid leave policies and enhanced our policies and procedures for a safe work environment both in the office and instore To keep our teams informed we deployed comprehensive resources with uptodate COVID19 information including a dedicated platform for teams returning to the office COVID19 case support implemented for all team members included returntowork guidance and contact tracing with the utmost regard for employee privacy We continue to offer special sick leave for employees with possible COVID19 symptoms as well as comprehensive health coverage To continue to manage our response going forward we created a dedicated pandemic response team in in addition to the crossfunctional team that has been supporting and guiding our COVID response The new response team will support future pandemic planning and response Innovating to support our customers Despite all of the pandemics challenges we brought our hardware software and services into customers hands helping them stay informed connected and entertained We also tailored our services to promote easy access to trusted information on COVID19 launching a dedicated section on Apple News prioritizing visibility of essential services locations including COVID19 testing and vaccination locations on Apple Maps offering a curated collection of telehealth apps on the App Store and leveraging Siri to provide the latest COVID19 guidance To meet the extraordinary challenges of virtual education we delivered new content and services for students parents and teachers to foster creativity and learning in a digital environment We worked with mobile carriers and school administrators to deliver iPad devices with cellular support for students in need With our Apple Card Customer Assistance Program we also offered customers the option to skip their monthly payments without incurring interest Across many of our Apple Store locations we were able to serve our customers needs through contactless pickup express storefronts and new online support Our response to COVID19 is still ongoing and were committed to implementing health protocols and adjusting store operations as required based on available data and guidance from health officials Apples COVID19 response The health of our teams customers and communities continues to be our first priority Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report Supporting people in our supply chain We are continuing to work together with our suppliers to help them ensure that every necessary precaution is taken to keep people safe at work In we introduced an enhancement to our Code and Standards specifically addressing Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response IDPR IDPR contains a set of new requirements resulting from our learnings during the pandemic which will help our suppliers better prepare for and be ready to respond to an infectious disease outbreak at their facility As part of the rollout of IDPR in fiscal year we conducted more than onsite and remote specialized assessments to verify suppliers compliance with COVID19 control protocols in order to drive improvement when necessary We also continue to assess any existing gaps at supplier facilities and identify opportunities to work with those in higherrisk areas to help make their facilities safer This includes working with thirdparty suppliers to redesign and reconfigure factory floor plans where necessary implementing flexible working hours to maximize interpersonal space implementing enhanced deep cleaning protocols and deploying masks and sanitizers In fiscal year we also encouraged our suppliers employees to get vaccinated and boosted where available We also partnered with NGOs to help further support supplier employees as well as those working deeper in our supply chain particularly those from vulnerable groups We worked with the International Organization for Migration IOM the worlds leading organization providing services to migrant workers to provide support to migrant workers impacted by the pandemic With support from Apple our longtime partner Pact an international development organization prepared and coordinated activities to prevent the spread of COVID19 in several mining communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC The initiative has reached more than people through individual and group dialogues on COVID19 prevention since the program began in December Giving back to our communities Apples companywide response to the COVID19 pandemic involved teams across the business including product design engineering operations packaging teams suppliers and more At the beginning of the pandemic when personal protective equipment was in short supply we sourced through our supply chain and donated more than million masks for healthcare workers worldwide We also launched a companywide effort to produce and ship over million face shields These face shields were delivered to sites around the world from New York Presbyterian Hospital in the US to the Ministry of Health in Zambia Additionally we have also donated over million to the World Health Organizations COVID19 Solidarity Response Fund We also matched employee donations twotoone to support COVID19 response efforts worldwide We awarded million from our Advanced Manufacturing Fund to COPAN diagnostics a market leader in sample collection kits that rapidly accelerated their ability to supply sample collection kits to hospitals in the US for COVID19 testing And our partnership with Product RED also supported COVID19 response see page Collaboration with our suppliers helps them make sure theyre taking every necessary precaution to keep people safe at work In partnership with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and the CDC we released an app and a website that guided Americans through a series of questions about their health and exposure to determine if they should seek care for COVID19 symptoms providing CDC recommendations on next steps including guidance on social distancing and selfisolating how to closely monitor symptoms recommendations on testing and when to contact a medical provider And we collaborated with Google to create a new exposure notification system for global governments and health agencies with user privacy and security central to its design

hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when theyre conducting business for Apple We abide by EHS requirements in every country where we operate and are dedicated to doing everything we can to support the safety and wellbeing of our global teams Managing workrelated hazards and risks To help ensure the safety of our workers and customers we put procedures in place to identify workplace risks and mitigate possible hazards We support and protect employees in lower hazard spaces and we put risk specific programs in place for those working in higher hazard environments including safe systems of work chemical management laser safety equipment and machinery safety hazardous materials management and electrical safety Employees can request to have their workspaces individually inspected to review hazards and controls including ergonomics evaluations Apple implements a hierarchy of control for significant risks which centers on elimination substitution engineering controls administrative controls and personal protective equipment PPE As one example Apple EHS regularly assesses hazards at our research labs based on their chemical equipment laser and other hazards Approximately percent of our labs are considered complex meaning that they contain highhazard processes and equipment These assessments help teams understand which EHS programs and controls must be put in place to mitigate risks In Apple completed hazard assessments in over research labs globally Our EHS teams identify and provide team members with appropriate PPE for specific hazards This PPE is provided at no cost and with training on correct use For example our hearing conservation programs include evaluation and control of occupational exposures to noise and hearing protection is available for processes areas and tasks with potential high noise exposures Additionally EHS conducts mandatory health checks for employees where theyre needed We invest in new technologies as we continue to manage potential risks across our operations including our Appleowned manufacturing sites Our standards programs trainings procedures and other safeguards are managed by trained EHS professionals and where required we also translate EHS procedures into local languages for our team members Risks identified from incidents injuries and nonroutine events are addressed expeditiously to identify and implement appropriate corrective and preventative actions and we integrate our learnings into future program development and training Lessons learned are routinely communicated across Apples EHS team and potentially affected operations and they are used to inform updates to existing policies and procedures Employees and managers can report incidents nearmisses and observations including newly identified hazards and risksthrough an internal iOS app Incident responses are addressed by Apples EHS team through a consistent process that connects employees with care and support while identifying corrective actions where appropriate to prevent future occurrences Waste management Apple is committed to minimizing resource use and the associated generation of non hazardous or hazardous waste Where possible Apple implements a waste hierarchy of prevention waste reduction at the source reuse of materials recycling energy recovery and landfilling as a last resort We maintain our commitment to the safe and responsible management of hazardous waste both onsite and offsite Any facility that does not meet our requirements is replaced by another approved waste management facility We made progress in at sites around the world US Thirteen of the Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities TSDFs we utilize in the US were audited in to confirm that the waste is treated recycled or incinerated within the governing safety standards for health and the environment Eight disposal facility reviews were completed by vendors under Apple management and we reviewed five other sites via thirdparty audit reports At one of our major research labs in Santa Clara Valley the empty container management program resulted in a percent reduction of lab debris for hazardous waste streams United Kingdom Through an internal initiative to further strengthen waste management product sitespecific waste initiatives achieved a percent diversion from landfill and a tonnes of waste1002 both exceeding requirements Ireland The Cork Campus is ECVP Zero Waste to Landfill Certified annually and has had no material landfilled in the past five years Ergonomics In we continued to support our global team members working from home office Apple office and nonoffice settings The Apple ergonomics program is heavily focused on preventative measures to reduce the risk of workrelated musculoskeletal disorders WMSDs This includes ergonomics training sessions for our team members and providing input into the purchase or design of work equipment systems and facilities to ensure that they meet ergonomic standards to provide the best levels of efficiency comfort health and safety for anyone using them Our Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report ergonomics trainings and selfassessment support are aimed at creating an awareness of ergonomic risk factors for WMSDs how to prevent them and how to proactively request for adjustments to workstations We completed over individual support requests for our team members working from home along with those who returned to Apple offices and Apple Store locations Support included tailored guidance and feedback equipment recommendations and virtual or inperson assessments In addition over employees participated in various training sessions Our industrial warehouse and other non office operations teams were supported with approximately ergonomic risk assessments and lab screenings The assessments evaluated risk factors such as repetition force posture and duration while reviewing the interaction of the team member with new machines equipment work processes and workspaces Emergency preparedness and response Beyond COVID19 we supported the response to dozens of crisis events in including fires severe weather and civil unrest Our responses focused on the safety of our employees and business continuity We activated crisis management teams CMTs to manage the most severe events and additional incidents were supported without full CMTs All team members can sign up for Apples Emergency Alert system enabling them to be notified of local emergencies and to indicate whether they are safe or need help Disaster supplies are available at our facilities All Apple campuses with over employees have Facility Response and Recovery Plans which provide a comprehensive approach to the safety and support of our employees while minimizing business interruption Sitespecific Emergency Response Plans have been implemented globally These plans are communicated to all employees and trainings and drills are held at least annually And our employees are trained in emergency response allowing them to react quickly while supporting the safety of our team members and customers In we completed over emergency response drills which were supported by trained Emergency Response Team ERT members We expect to increase the frequency of these drills depending on COVID19 restrictions With the care and support of our employees and customers in mind we deployed Automatic External Defibrillator AED stations across our global retail stores in And to ensure that our team members could effectively use this new tool we provided AED training for our team members All campuses and key sites have disaster supplies to match localized risks As Apples footprint grows sites are evaluated and supplies are added as needed As one example in we launched earthquake preparedness campaigns for employees across the western United

from entering our supply chain for being unable or unwilling to meet our Code and Standards Once new suppliers are awarded Apple business we begin the process of helping them quickly get up to speed on our requirements through our supplier onboarding process In we expanded our onboarding process to engage new suppliers at an even earlier stage in their working relationship with Apple We also

companies Since percent of companies that were not awarded Apple business elected to join this voluntary program helping to protect people and the planet beyond the reach of our business and supply chain Supplier engagement and accountability We take a broad comprehensive approach to engaging with our suppliers to confirm that our standards are met One of the tools that we employ are assessments Assessments also known as audits are one of several methods we use to measure compliance with our requirements These independent thirdparty assessments which take place onsite at supplier facilities provide a snapshot of a suppliers performance However when combined with regular engagement with supplier teams mandated reporting and listening directly to hundreds of thousands of supplier employees about their workplace experiences our rigorous supplier assessments provide a clear measure of their performance in upholding our Code and Standards In the reporting period assessments were conducted in countries This included Code of Conduct assessments and smelter and refiner assessments20 Since Applemanaged assessments have covered percent of our direct manufacturing spend The Apple Supply Chain million people Thousands of businesses and facilities countries Our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report page provides a detailed overview of progress in our supply chain including efforts to identify mitigate prevent and remedy human rights risks as outlined by the Business and Human Rights Due Diligence process set forth in the UNGPs We work closely with many experts across Apple from product and services designers to facility managers to evaluate and update our Code and Standards annually to address emerging risks incorporate new legal requirements and industry best practices and reflect the needs of supplier employees in a dynamic operating environment We engage with a range of stakeholders including rights holders civil society organizations academic experts

Our goal is to work together with suppliers to help them improve their management systems rather than to simply remove them from our supply chain without helping them correct the issues we have discovered In the event that a supplier is unwilling or unable to improve their operations to meet our requirements they risk removal from our supply chain Since we have directed the removal of manufacturing supplier facilities and smelters and refiners from our supply chain for being unwilling or unable to sufficiently improve their operations to meet our requirements Results of our assessments are detailed in our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report beginning on page A responsibility that grows with our business As Apples business continues to grow and expand to new areas we adapt our supplier engagement model accordingly This includes continuing to expand our scope to conduct independent thirdparty assessments of a growing number of suppliers that support our business outside of manufacturing Last year we increased our engagement and expanded the application of our Code and Standards to suppliers supporting newer areas of Apples business including those that work with our content services like Apple TV and Apple Fitness Supplier employees at Final Assembly in the US How we stay engaged with suppliers widely used by the industry A total of RBA VAP assessments were completed in fiscal year at Apple supplier sites If we uncover noncompliance in the course of any assessment or engagement we take prompt action so that suppliers not only correct and remedy the issue but make meaningful longterm changes to their systems and processes We do this through a Corrective Action Plan CAP during which and 90day checkins with Apple are required We then conduct our Corrective Action Verification CAV process to verify that all corrective actions have been successfully implemented and necessary steps have Code of conduct assessments Specialized assessments Investigations Capability building Ongoing training Early engagement These assessments also include unannounced assessments and unannounced visits in response to workers grievances and allegations or to verify risks at supplier facilities based on predictive analytics In fiscal year unannounced assessments and investigations were conducted where the supplier facility was provided no advance notice of our arrival This is nearly double the number conducted in In addition to thirdparty Code of Conduct assessments we require many of our suppliers to also undergo the Responsible Business Alliances RBA Validated Assessment Program VAP a facilitywide thirdparty assessment Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report

Chain Report for more detail on the organizations we work with Labor and human rights in the supply chain People come first in everything we do Our commitment to protecting the people in our supply chain has been unwavering anchored by a simple set of beliefs People deserve to be treated with dignity and to know their rights They should be able to speak up if those rights are not being respected and to know and expect that when they do we will listen and act Were committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain We are committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain just like we do for our team members customers and other partners and more broadly to working with others to share our tools and the lessons weve learned and to empowering everyone to achieve progress more rapidly Listening to workers Effective grievance channels ongoing worker management communications and supplier employee feedback are essential to ensuring respect for worker rights and maintaining safe and healthy workplaces Whether through social dialogue and formal employee representation workplace satisfaction surveys anonymous hotlines focus groups or interviews during annual assessments the feedback we receive directly from supplier employees helps us ensure labor and human rights are respected throughout our global supply chain We also use this feedback to address emerging risks improve rights training for supplier employees and supplier management and to continually strengthen our Code and Standards Rights awareness We believe that protection starts with rights awareness and since more than million supplier employees have been trained on their workplace rights Under our Code and Standards suppliers are required to provide employees with training on their workplace rights This training is generally conducted during new employee orientation and covers international labor standards local labor laws environmental health and safety and the protections required by our Code and Standards Feedback channels Supplier employee interviews are an important part of every assessment conducted Each year we interview tens of thousands of supplier employees in their local language and without their managers present to determine whether or not their experience on the job aligns with auditors observations during assessments In fiscal year despite the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID19 pandemic we interviewed workers in our supply chain over more than were interviewed in the previous fiscal year Our Code and Standards require effective worker feedback channels including grievance mechanisms at all supplier sites We also provide thirdparty anonymous hotlines which are also available to our employees see page and the ability to contact the Apple Environment and Supply Chain Innovation ESCI team directly at any time and in any language When an issue is raised we require supplier management to immediately investigate and to resolve the issue in a timely manner In we launched a grievance hotline awareness campaign and its initial rollout resulted in a percent increase in utilization of these thirdparty hotlines The reports we received from supplier employees via hotlines in included issues related to wages and benefits employee relations amenities at supplier facilities workforce stability and health and safety In each case we investigated and worked directly with the suppliers to drive improvement and correct any compliance issues found Suppliers implemented a number of actions as a result of supplier employee feedback through these Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report channels including improvements to working hours resignation processes timing of bonuses and the use of personal protective equipment PPE Workplace satisfaction In addition to interviews and grievance channels we also engage with supplier employees to understand their overall workplace satisfaction In we anonymously surveyed supplier employees in facilities across Greater China India Ireland Malaysia Philippines Singapore UK US and Vietnam about their workplace experiences nearly double the number of supplier employees surveyed last fiscal year As a result suppliers took actions including better commute options increasing wages and bonuses offering better food variety and skill development opportunities for entrylevel managers Responsible labor recruitment Our Code and Standards and the protections they provide apply equally to all workers regardless of a persons job geographic location or how they enter our supply chain and this commitment begins even before a worker ever enters our supply chain This includes zero tolerance for forced labor We implement strict policies and procedures with our suppliers to protect workers in our supply chain from forced labor This includes selecting suppliers for assessments based on factors such as their geographic location which may put them at higher risk of forced labor violations as well as their previous performance andor history of violations or allegations Suppliers may also receive additional specialized assessments based on the nature of their business or employee population such as those that employ Foreign Contract Workers and those located in higher risk migration corridors Our Code and Standards also require that all supplier employees have an effective mechanism to report grievances In addition we provide thirdparty anonymous hotlines and the ability to contact the Apple Environment and Supply Chain Innovation ESCI team directly at any time and in any language When an issue is raised supplier management is required to promptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a timely manner We strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor throughout our worldwide supply chain and look for evidence of it in every supplier assessment we conduct including unannounced assessments Last year we conducted more than assessments and found no instances where anyone was forced to work in our supply chain We did discover two cases in Taiwan in which people paid recruitment fees to secure their job which is a violation of our Code We required the supplier to directly repay their employees in full and verified repayment through a thirdparty auditor The payment of recruitment fees withholding an employees passport or personal identity documents or restricting an employees freedom of movement are Core Violations of our Code and Standards the most serious level of Code violations If we discover workers have paid recruitment fees at any point on their employment journey to an Apple supplier we require supplier management to take prompt action to provide remedy to those affected by directly repaying their workers for any and all fees even if the supplier was unaware that their employees had paid recruitment fees From through fiscal year our suppliers have repaid million in recruitment fees directly to workers Finally in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration IOM and the Responsible Business Alliance RBA we expanded our Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit to more than additional supplier facilities in countries reaching nearly workers globally with percent of those working on Apple production lines 236M supplier employees trained on their rights since supplier employees directly engaged about their workplace experiences through interviews and satisfaction surveys supplier employees reached by grievance hotline awareness campaign Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples ESG Report How we work to prevent forced labor in our supply chain Apple has zero tolerance for forced labor In the more than countries and regions where our suppliers operate we have teams of experts including independent third parties who monitor our suppliers and put in place industryleading procedures to help ensure that no one is forced to work Our comprehensive policies start before we even sign a contract with suppliers and we are consistently raising the bar We set the highest standards Eliminating forced labor begins with setting and maintaining the highest standards Our standards often go above and beyond legal requirements to protect people from forced labor risks We engage early To address forced labor risks at its roots we know that our work has to begin before people enter our supply chain We hold suppliers accountable Once weve implemented thorough preventative measures independent thirdparty assessments verify that our suppliers are meeting our standards Looking for evidence of forced labor is part of every supplier assessment If we find any violations of our Code and Standards we take swift action to remedy the issue and improve their operations We track progress and report transparently Consistent improvement requires transparency and accountability Since we have been publishing reports on our efforts across all of our work to transparently share our progress and challenges We regularly engage and partner with stakeholders Engagement with stakeholders and rights holders is critical to accountability ensuring were taking action where its needed and to achieving rapid progress Aligning with international frameworks Apple policies and our supplier requirements align with international labor and human rights standards including those of the International Labour Organization the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights UNGPs and the Organisation for Economic CoOperation and Development The Apple Human Rights Policy Our Human Rights Policy outlines how we treat everyone including our customers employees business partners and the people across every level of our supply chain Read the Apple Human Rights Policy The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards Our supplier requirements contain strict standards for responsible labor recruitment and apply to all suppliers protecting workers globally We go above and beyond legal requirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor recruitment in regions where we cannot conduct adequate due diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy because we believe no one should pay to secure a job Read the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards Thorough mapping informs our strategy An effective strategy requires deep understanding of our supply chain To date we have mapped over labor recruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across countries A leading strategy requires leading tools The Apple Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit developed in partnership with the International Organization for Migration provides suppliers and their labor agencies with easytouse tools that help them effectively manage and report data mitigating forced labor risks before people even enter our supply chain In addition to providing handson training we are making these tools openly available for others to use Awareness is power We require our suppliers to provide their employees with training on their workplace rights on their first day on the job This helps to ensure that every person is aware of their rights and what to do if theyre not being respected which includes the ability to anonymously contact Apple directly Foreign Contract Workers who make up a very small percentage of people in our supply chain also receive training prior to leaving their home country as well as upon arriving in their destination country To date our suppliers have provided workplace rights training to over million people In addition last year we directly engaged with over people in our supply chain to learn more about their workplace experience Investing in consistent improvement Through our new Supplier Employee Development Fund were investing 50M to expand programs designed to continue to improve the rights training experience worker voice platforms and supplier employee education opportunities A close look We regularly conduct independent thirdparty assessments including surprise assessments of our suppliers verifying compliance with over points across our standards This includes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring and personnel records are in place and accurate In addition to specialized forced labor assessments for atrisk suppliers we also require many suppliers to participate in facilitywide assessments such as the Validated Assessment Program to verify performance across the suppliers entire business In the event that we find gaps in a suppliers compliance or capabilities we require them to implement a Corrective Action Plan To date our assessments have covered percent of our direct manufacturing spend We investigate every report In addition to thoroughly assessing our suppliers performance in upholding our standards we also receive reports from the press governments civil society and people in our supply chain and we encourage the public to report concerns via httpswwwapplecomuksupplierresponsibility We investigate every report and frequently have Apple teams onsite within hours Swift action and steep penalties Forced labor in any form is a Core Violation the most serious violation level of our requirements If a Core Violation is discovered the suppliers CEO is notified and the supplier is immediately placed on probation pending the successful completion of a Corrective Action Plan Probation can include no new projects no new business and termination of existing business In addition to commercial penalties if a supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our standards they risk removal from our supply chain Since we have directed the removal of manufacturing supplier facilities and smelters and refiners for failure to meet our requirements Action this year In FY21 across more than assessments we found no instances where anyone was forced to work in our supply chain We did find two cases where employees of the same supplier in Taiwan paid recruitment fees Per our requirements the supplier directly repaid their employees for those fees To date our suppliers have directly repaid 332M in

for corporate emissions as of April Emissions from RD processes Beginning in FY2021 were accounting for scope emissions from the purchase of district heating chilled water and steam In fiscal year we started calculating scope emissions not listed in this table In fiscal year these include electricity transmission and distribution losses amounted to about metric tons CO2e and life cycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about metric tons CO2e We have not accounted for emissions resulting from employees working from home because we anticipated these emissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving our methodology We regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability standards So in fiscal year we changed how we calculate emissions from business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air travel As a result of this change our scope transportation emissions increased by percent between and Without the methodology change these emissions would have increased by percent which reflects the growth in our business Beginning in fiscal year we updated our methodology to reflect the impact of COVID19 on employee commute We retired metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards Because were committed to accuracy and transparency we regularly refine our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data For example we recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our products are sold and used resulting in more granularity possible for grid emission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase The net result was an increase in our carbon footprint When using the same level of data granularity and model as our product use carbon emissions in would have been about percent lower For fiscal year we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya and purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total of metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain The first project a REDD coastal conservation project in Guatemala protects and conserves forests from deforestation and degradation The second project aims to establish forests on about hectares of barren land that is not otherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China Both projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for projects in the
