# ESG Demo System for analysing and visualising report data

The main aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly, and interactive demo system for ESG report analysis. To accomplish this, the project sets out to achieve the following key objectives:

• Interactive user interface: Design and develop a user interface that facilitates the submission of ESG reports and presents the extracted data in a visually engaging manner, ensuring ease of navigation and accessibility for users of varying technical expertise.

• ESG topic visualisation Preprocess and transform raw ESG data to derive structured topic taxonomies and models, and subsequently display results in an interactive visualisation that intuitively represents the hierarchical and thematic relationships within ESG reports.

• ESG report visualisation: Develop a methodology that offers users a clear intuitive and interactive visualisation of the structure and nuanced details of an ESG report.

• Comparative analysis: Implement a feature that allows users to compare multiple companies’ ESG reports and commitments side-by-side, highlighting both commendations and criticisms related to ESG practices.

• Sentiment analysis visualisation: Utilize sentiment analysis techniques to assess variations in sentiment throughout the report and across its different sections, then visually represent these findings.

• Articulate and explore system implications: Assess the transformative implications of the demo system for a spectrum of stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and consumers. Discuss its potential for promoting transparency and accountability in ESG reporting.

• Evaluate system performance: Evaluate the usability of the demo system, identify potential areas for improvement, and explore avenues for future developments
