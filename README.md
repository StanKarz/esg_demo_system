# ESG Demo System for Analyzing and Visualizing Report Data

The main aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly and interactive demo system for ESG report analysis. To accomplish this, the project sets out to achieve the following key objectives:

---

## Interactive User Interface

Design and develop a user interface that facilitates the submission of ESG reports and presents the extracted data in a visually engaging manner. The interface ensures ease of navigation and accessibility for users of varying technical expertise.

## ESG Report Visualization

Develop a methodology to provide users with clear, intuitive, and interactive visualizations of the structure and nuanced details of ESG reports.

### Examples:
1. **Report Structure Example 1**

## ESG Topic Visualization

Preprocess and transform raw ESG data to derive structured topic taxonomies and models, and display the results in interactive visualizations that intuitively represent hierarchical and thematic relationships within ESG reports.

### Examples:
1. **Topic Modeling Visualization**

## Comparative Analysis

Implement a feature that allows users to compare multiple companies’ ESG reports and commitments side-by-side, highlighting commendations and criticisms of ESG practices.

## Company Search and Filter

The ability to efficiently search and filter through a vast data set is crucial for users who are looking for specific information. In the context of this application, this feature is essential given the extensive list of companies and their associated details. The company search feature allows users to quickly locate companies based on various criteria such as name, industry, and exchange. It incorporates a simple text search along with advanced filtering options, enabling users to narrow down their results by specific sectors or exchanges.

### Examples:
1. **Topic Modeling Visualization**

## Sentiment Analysis Visualization

Utilize sentiment analysis techniques to assess variations in sentiment throughout the report and its sections. Visually represent these findings to offer actionable insights.

## ESG Word Frequency Visualization

This feature aims to visualize the frequency of ESG-related words in reports using two complementary approaches: bubble charts and word clouds.

### Bubble Chart:
The bubble chart provides a panoramic view of the most frequently used words in the ESG report. Bubbles are colour-coded based on their category, offering an immediate visual representation of which aspects of ESG are predominant in a report.

### Word Clouds:
Complementing the bubble chart are three-word clouds, each focused on the Environmental, Social, and Governance sectors. Word clouds emphasize words based on their frequency, with more frequent terms appearing larger and bolder. This allows users to delve deeper into each ESG category, gaining insights into specific areas of emphasis without sifting through dense text.

These visualization approaches transform voluminous and complex data into digestible, actionable insights. Users can identify key themes and trends almost instantly. Additionally, these tools support comparative analysis—juxtaposing bubble charts or word clouds from different reports can help identify industry trends, shifts in priorities, or company-specific focuses.
